## Study Notes

### 1. üìö Introduction to NoSQL Databases

In the world of data management, **NoSQL databases** have emerged as an important alternative to traditional relational databases (RDBMS). The term **NoSQL** originally meant "No SQL," implying a rejection of the SQL language and relational model. However, it has evolved to mean **"Not Only SQL"**, emphasizing that these databases are not strictly relational but can coexist with SQL databases.

NoSQL databases are defined primarily by what they are **not**: they are **non-relational databases**. This means they do not use the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. The term was popularized around 2009 during meetups and conferences involving creators of new database technologies designed to handle modern data challenges.

#### Why did NoSQL databases become popular?

Four main trends drove the rise of NoSQL:

- **Data Size:** The explosion of data volumes, especially with web-scale companies like Google and Facebook, made traditional databases struggle to scale.
- **Connectedness:** Modern applications require handling highly connected data, which relational models find cumbersome.
- **Semi-structured Data:** Unlike the rigid schemas of SQL databases, modern data is often semi-structured or unstructured, requiring flexible schemas.
- **Architecture:** Traditional RDBMS architectures have limitations in scalability, availability, and geographic distribution, which NoSQL databases address.


### 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Understanding SQL Databases and Their Characteristics

Before diving deeper into NoSQL, it‚Äôs important to understand the basics of **SQL databases**:

- **Data Storage:** Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
- **Relationships:** Relationships between data are represented explicitly using keys (primary and foreign keys).
- **Languages:** SQL databases use **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** for querying and modifying data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and **Data Definition Language (DDL)** for defining schemas and constraints.
- **Transactions:** SQL databases support **ACID** properties to ensure reliable transactions:
  - **Atomicity:** All parts of a transaction succeed or none do.
  - **Consistency:** Transactions move the database from one valid state to another.
  - **Isolation:** Transactions do not interfere with each other.
  - **Durability:** Once committed, changes survive failures.
- **Physical Layer Abstraction:** Applications specify *what* data they want, not *how* to get it. The database engine optimizes queries and manages physical storage.


### 3. üöÄ Why NoSQL? The Limitations of RDBMS and New Requirements

Traditional relational databases were designed decades ago for different types of applications. Modern web applications have different needs:

- **Scalability:** RDBMS struggle to scale horizontally across many servers.
- **Latency:** Web apps require low and predictable response times.
- **Availability:** Systems must remain operational even if some servers fail.
- **Flexible Schemas:** Data formats evolve rapidly, and rigid schemas slow down development.
- **Geographic Distribution:** Data must be replicated across multiple data centers worldwide.

NoSQL databases address these by relaxing some traditional guarantees (like strong consistency) and focusing on **scalability, availability, and flexibility**.


### 4. üîÑ CAP Theorem and BASE Model: Trade-offs in Distributed Systems

In distributed databases, the **CAP theorem** states that a system can only guarantee two of the following three properties simultaneously:

- **Consistency:** All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- **Availability:** Every request receives a response, even if some nodes fail.
- **Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to operate despite network failures between nodes.

NoSQL databases often prioritize **Availability** and **Partition Tolerance** over strict Consistency, leading to the **BASE** model:

- **Basically Available:** The system guarantees availability.
- **Soft state:** The system state may change over time without input.
- **Eventually Consistent:** The system will become consistent over time, but not immediately.

This contrasts with the ACID model of SQL databases, which emphasizes strong consistency and transaction integrity.


### 5. üóÉÔ∏è Types of NoSQL Databases and Their Characteristics

NoSQL databases come in several types, each optimized for different use cases:

#### Column Store Databases
- Store data by columns rather than rows.
- Efficient for queries that access only a few columns.
- Example: **Google BigTable**, **HBase**, **Ingres VectorWise**.
- Data is stored in column families, compressed together for efficiency.
- Good for large-scale, sparse data.

#### Key-Value Stores
- Store data as simple key-value pairs, like a hash table.
- Very fast for lookups by key.
- Limited query capabilities (usually exact key matches only).
- Examples: **Amazon Dynamo**, **Project Voldemort**, **MemCacheDB**.
- Used for session management, user profiles, caching.

#### Document Stores
- Store data as documents, typically in JSON or XML format.
- Schema-free, allowing flexible and evolving data structures.
- Support complex nested data.
- Examples: **CouchDB**, **MongoDB**.
- Support replication and versioning.
- Use MapReduce for indexing and querying large datasets.

#### Other Types
- **Graph Databases:** Optimized for highly connected data (e.g., social networks).
- **XML Databases:** Store and query XML documents.
- **Object-Oriented Databases:** Store objects directly.
- **Codasyl Databases:** Older network database model.


### 6. üèóÔ∏è Deep Dive: Google BigTable and Dynamo Examples

#### Google BigTable
- A **sparse, distributed, persistent multidimensional sorted map**.
- Data model includes rows, columns, and timestamps.
- Rows are sorted by key and partitioned into tablets for efficient range scans.
- Column families group related columns for storage and compression.
- Uses a single master server to assign tablets to many tablet servers.
- Designed for scalability and high availability.

#### Amazon Dynamo
- A **peer-to-peer key-value store** designed for high availability and scalability.
- Uses consistent hashing to distribute data.
- Supports object versioning and quorum reads for eventual consistency.
- Designed for simple query models with unique keys and no complex joins.
- Prioritizes low latency and fault tolerance.


### 7. üìù Data Manipulation and Querying in NoSQL

Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases often:

- Use **procedural programming languages** (Java, C, etc.) for data retrieval.
- Lack a declarative query language like SQL.
- Do not have a query optimizer; applications specify exactly how to access data.
- Support **asynchronous inserts and updates**, meaning writes do not wait for confirmation.
- Use **versioning** and **optimistic concurrency** to handle conflicts.


### 8. ‚öñÔ∏è Advantages and Disadvantages of NoSQL

#### Advantages
- **Massive scalability:** Can handle huge volumes of data across many servers.
- **High availability:** Designed to remain operational despite failures.
- **Lower cost:** Often cheaper to scale horizontally than traditional RDBMS.
- **Schema flexibility:** Can handle semi-structured or evolving data easily.
- **Elasticity:** Can grow or shrink capacity predictably.

#### Disadvantages
- **Limited query capabilities:** Complex queries and joins are difficult or unsupported.
- **Eventual consistency:** Programming for eventual consistency is more complex.
- **No standardization:** Each NoSQL database has its own API and query language.
- **Portability issues:** Moving data between NoSQL systems can be challenging.
- **Security:** Access control and security models may be less mature.


### 9. üîç Summary and Current Trends

NoSQL databases emerged to meet the demands of modern web-scale applications that require:

- Handling **big data** volumes.
- **Distributed architectures** across many servers and data centers.
- Flexible, **schema-less data models**.
- High **availability** and **scalability** at low cost.
- Relaxed consistency models (BASE) instead of strict ACID transactions.
