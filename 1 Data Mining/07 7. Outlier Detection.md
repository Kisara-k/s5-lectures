## Study Notes on Outlier Detection üìä



### 1. üåü Introduction to Outlier Detection

Outlier detection is a crucial task in data mining and analysis, where the goal is to identify data points that significantly differ from the majority of the data. These unusual points, called **outliers**, can reveal important insights or signal anomalies such as fraud, errors, or rare events.

For example, in 2017, astronomers observed an object named ‚ÄòOumuamua, which was the first known object to come from outside our Solar System ‚Äî a true outlier in astronomical data. Similarly, in fraud detection, unusual credit card transactions in terms of amount, location, or timing can indicate fraudulent activity.

Outlier detection is widely applied in various fields such as:

- **Credit card fraud detection:** spotting unusual spending patterns.
- **Stock market fraud:** detecting suspicious transaction chains.
- **Healthcare insurance:** identifying abnormal patient-doctor visit patterns.



### 2. üîç Understanding Outliers and Noise

It‚Äôs important to distinguish **outliers** from **noise**:

- **Noise** refers to random errors or small variations in data measurement that do not carry meaningful information.
- **Outliers**, on the other hand, are data points that violate the normal data generation process and often carry significant meaning.

An outlier is not just a random error; it often signals something unusual or important. For example, a patient visiting a doctor every week for flu might be an outlier indicating a potential health issue or fraud.

There is also a related concept called **novelty detection**, which focuses on identifying new patterns that were not seen before but may later become part of the normal data model.



### 3. üß© Types of Outliers

Outliers can be categorized into three main types:

#### 3.1 Global Outliers (Point Anomalies)
A **global outlier** is a single data point that deviates significantly from the entire dataset. For example, a temperature reading of 10¬∞C in a tropical city might be a global outlier.

**Challenge:** Defining a good measure of deviation to identify these points.

#### 3.2 Contextual Outliers
A **contextual outlier** depends on the context or environment. The same data point might be normal in one context but an outlier in another.

- Example: 10¬∞C in Vancouver might be normal in winter but an outlier in summer.
- Data attributes are split into:
  - **Contextual attributes:** define the context (e.g., time, location).
  - **Behavioral attributes:** describe the object‚Äôs characteristics (e.g., temperature).

**Challenge:** Defining meaningful contexts for evaluation.

#### 3.3 Collective Outliers
A **collective outlier** is a group of data points that together deviate significantly, even if individual points seem normal.

- Example: A group of computers sending denial-of-service attacks collectively form an outlier pattern.
- Requires understanding relationships or similarity among data points.



### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges in Outlier Detection

Outlier detection faces several challenges:

- **Modeling normal vs. outlier behavior:** It‚Äôs difficult to enumerate all normal behaviors, and the boundary between normal and outlier is often fuzzy.
- **Application-specific definitions:** What counts as an outlier in one domain (e.g., healthcare) may not be the same in another (e.g., marketing).
- **Handling noise:** Noise can obscure the distinction between normal data and outliers.
- **Interpretability:** It‚Äôs important to explain why a data point is considered an outlier and quantify how unusual it is.



### 5. üõ†Ô∏è Methods of Outlier Detection

Outlier detection methods can be broadly classified based on the availability of labeled data and assumptions about data:

#### 5.1 Supervised Methods
- Treat outlier detection as a classification problem.
- Use labeled examples of normal and outlier data to train models.
- Challenges:
  - Outliers are rare, causing class imbalance.
  - Recall (catching all outliers) is more important than overall accuracy.

#### 5.2 Unsupervised Methods
- Assume normal data forms clusters; outliers lie far from these clusters.
- Do not require labeled data.
- Weakness: May fail to detect collective outliers or outliers in sparse clusters.

#### 5.3 Semi-Supervised Methods
- Use a small amount of labeled data (normal or outliers) combined with unlabeled data.
- Often model normal data and flag deviations as outliers.
- Can combine supervised and unsupervised techniques for better performance.



### 6. üìà Statistical and Model-Based Approaches

These methods assume that normal data follows a statistical model, and points that do not fit this model are outliers.

- **Parametric models:** Assume data follows a known distribution (e.g., normal distribution) with parameters estimated from data.
- **Non-parametric models:** Do not assume a fixed distribution; instead, estimate the model from data (e.g., histograms, kernel density estimation).

#### Example: Univariate Outlier Detection Using Normal Distribution
- Estimate mean (Œº) and standard deviation (œÉ) from data.
- Values outside Œº ¬± 3œÉ are considered outliers (covers 99.7% of normal data).
- Example: A temperature reading far from the mean by more than 3œÉ is an outlier.

#### Boxplot Method
- Uses five-number summary: Min, Q1 (lower quartile), Median, Q3 (upper quartile), Max.
- Outliers are points outside Q1 - 1.5√óIQR or Q3 + 1.5√óIQR, where IQR = Q3 - Q1.

#### Grubb‚Äôs Test
- Uses z-scores and t-distribution to statistically test if a point is an outlier.



### 7. üìê Proximity-Based Outlier Detection

These methods rely on the concept of distance or density among data points.

- **Distance-based outliers:** Points with few neighbors within a certain distance are outliers.
- **Density-based outliers:** Points with significantly lower local density compared to neighbors are outliers.

Key concepts:

- **k-distance:** Distance to the k-th nearest neighbor.
- **k-distance neighborhood:** All points within the k-distance.
- **Reachability distance:** Adjusted distance considering the k-distance of neighbors.
- **Local Reachability Density (LRD):** Inverse of average reachability distance to neighbors.
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF):** Ratio comparing LRD of a point to its neighbors; higher LOF means more outlying.



### 8. üßÆ Reconstruction-Based Methods

These methods assume normal data can be succinctly represented and reconstructed, while outliers cannot.

- Use techniques like **matrix factorization** (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition - SVD) for numeric data.
- For categorical data, use pattern-based compression.
- Outliers are points with poor reconstruction quality.



### 9. üîç Clustering and Classification-Based Outlier Detection

- **Clustering-based:** Outliers are points that do not belong to any cluster, belong to small/sparse clusters, or are far from cluster centers.
- **Classification-based:** Train classifiers to distinguish normal vs. outlier data.
- **One-class classification:** Model only the normal class boundary; points outside are outliers. Useful for detecting new, unseen outliers.



### 10. üåê Contextual and Collective Outlier Detection

#### Contextual Outliers
- Outliers relative to a specific context (e.g., time, location).
- Approach:
  - Identify context using contextual attributes.
  - Compare behavior within that context.
  - Use conventional outlier detection methods within the context.

#### Collective Outliers
- Groups of data points that collectively deviate.
- Requires understanding relationships or structures among data points.
- Often used in network intrusion detection or fraud rings.



### 11. üìä Outlier Detection in High-Dimensional Data

High-dimensional data presents unique challenges:

- Data sparsity makes distance measures less meaningful.
- Outliers may only appear in certain subspaces.
- The number of subspaces grows exponentially, making detection computationally expensive.

Approaches include:

- Using rank-based distances instead of absolute distances (e.g., HilOut).
- Angle-based methods that consider the geometric distribution of points.



### 12. üìù Summary

Outlier detection is a diverse and complex field with many practical applications. Key takeaways include:

- Outliers can be global, contextual, or collective.
- Different methods suit different data types and applications: statistical, proximity-based, clustering, classification, and reconstruction-based.
- Handling noise, interpretability, and application-specific definitions are major challenges.
- High-dimensional data requires specialized techniques.
- Understanding the context and relationships among data points improves detection accuracy.
