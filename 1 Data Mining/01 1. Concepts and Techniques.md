## Study Notes: Getting to Know Your Data üìä



### 1. üß© Understanding Data Objects and Attribute Types

When working with data mining, the first step is to understand the **data itself** ‚Äî what it represents and how it is structured. This involves knowing what **data objects** and **attributes** are, and the different types of attributes you might encounter.

#### What Are Data Objects?

- **Data objects** are the fundamental units or entities in a dataset. Think of them as the "things" you are studying or analyzing.
- Examples:
  - In a sales database, data objects could be customers, products, or transactions.
  - In a medical database, data objects might be patients or treatments.
  - In a university database, data objects could be students, professors, or courses.
- Other names for data objects include **samples, examples, instances, data points, tuples**, or simply **rows** in a database table.

#### What Are Attributes?

- Attributes describe the characteristics or features of data objects. They are the **columns** in a database table.
- For example, a customer object might have attributes like customer ID, name, age, and purchase history.
- Attributes are also called **dimensions, features, or variables**.

#### Types of Attributes

Attributes come in different types, and understanding these types is crucial because it affects how you analyze and process the data.

1. **Nominal Attributes**  
   - These are categorical attributes with no inherent order. They represent categories or names.  
   - Examples: Hair color (black, brown, blond), marital status, zip codes.  
   - They simply label data without implying any ranking or magnitude.

2. **Binary Attributes**  
   - A special case of nominal attributes with only two possible values (0 or 1).  
   - **Symmetric binary**: Both outcomes are equally important (e.g., gender: male/female).  
   - **Asymmetric binary**: One outcome is more important (e.g., medical test results: positive/negative). Usually, the important outcome is coded as 1.

3. **Ordinal Attributes**  
   - These have a meaningful order or ranking but the difference between values is not necessarily uniform or known.  
   - Examples: Size (small, medium, large), grades (A, B, C), military ranks.  
   - You know the order but not the exact distance between ranks.

4. **Numeric Attributes**  
   - Quantitative attributes that represent measurable quantities.  
   - Two subtypes:  
     - **Interval-scaled**: Values have order and equal intervals but no true zero point (e.g., temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, calendar dates).  
     - **Ratio-scaled**: Have a true zero point, allowing meaningful ratios (e.g., height, weight, temperature in Kelvin, monetary amounts).

5. **Discrete vs. Continuous Attributes**  
   - **Discrete**: Take on countable values (e.g., number of children, zip codes).  
   - **Continuous**: Can take any real value within a range (e.g., height, temperature). Usually represented with floating-point numbers.



### 2. üìà Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data

Before diving into complex analysis, it‚Äôs important to summarize and understand the data‚Äôs basic statistical properties. This helps reveal the **central tendency**, **spread**, and **distribution** of the data.

#### Central Tendency

- **Mean (Average)**: The sum of all values divided by the number of values. It‚Äôs sensitive to extreme values (outliers).  
- **Median**: The middle value when data is sorted. If there‚Äôs an even number of values, it‚Äôs the average of the two middle values. The median is robust to outliers.  
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value(s). Data can be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes), or multimodal.

#### Dispersion (Spread)

- **Range**: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.  
- **Quartiles**: Divide data into four equal parts.  
  - Q1 (25th percentile), Q2 (median, 50th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile).  
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Q3 - Q1, measures the middle 50% spread.  
- **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Measure how much data varies around the mean. Variance is the average squared deviation; standard deviation is its square root, giving a measure in the original units.

#### Outliers

- Values that lie far outside the typical range of data.  
- Often defined as points beyond 1.5 times the IQR above Q3 or below Q1.

#### Visual Tools for Statistical Description

- **Boxplot**: Graphical summary showing minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum, and outliers.  
- **Histogram**: Bar graph showing frequency distribution of data values.  
- **Quantile Plot**: Plots data values against their cumulative frequency to visualize distribution.  
- **Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot**: Compares quantiles of two distributions to see if they differ systematically.  
- **Scatter Plot**: Plots pairs of values to observe relationships or clusters.



### 3. üé® Data Visualization Techniques

Visualizing data helps us **see patterns, trends, and anomalies** that might be hard to detect from raw numbers alone. It also aids in communicating findings clearly.

#### Why Visualize Data?

- To gain insight into large and complex datasets.  
- To identify patterns, clusters, outliers, and relationships.  
- To guide further analysis and parameter tuning.  
- To provide visual confirmation of computational results.

#### Categories of Visualization Methods

1. **Pixel-Oriented Visualization**  
   - Each data value is mapped to a pixel with color representing the value.  
   - Useful for very high-dimensional data by showing multiple attributes simultaneously.  
   - Pixels can be arranged in creative ways, like circle segments, to save space and show relationships.

2. **Geometric Projection Visualization**  
   - Projects high-dimensional data into 2D or 3D space for easier viewing.  
   - Examples:  
     - **Scatterplots and scatterplot matrices**: Show pairwise relationships between attributes.  
     - **Landscapes**: Represent data as 3D terrain to visualize density or value gradients.  
     - **Parallel Coordinates**: Each attribute is an axis; data points are lines crossing these axes at values, revealing clusters and correlations.

3. **Icon-Based Visualization**  
   - Uses icons whose features (shape, size, color) represent data attributes.  
   - Examples:  
     - **Chernoff Faces**: Map variables to facial features (eye size, mouth shape) to visualize multivariate data intuitively.  
     - **Stick Figures**: Use limb angles and lengths to represent data.

4. **Hierarchical Visualization**  
   - Visualizes data with hierarchical or nested structures.  
   - Examples:  
     - **Dimensional Stacking**: Stacks 2D plots of attributes within each other to visualize multiple dimensions.  
     - **Tree-Maps**: Partition screen space into rectangles sized and colored by attribute values, useful for hierarchical data like file systems.  
     - **Cone Trees**: 3D visualization of hierarchical data with nodes arranged in concentric circles.

5. **Visualizing Complex Data and Relations**  
   - For non-numeric data like text or social networks.  
   - Examples:  
     - **Tag Clouds**: Show word frequency by font size and color.  
     - **Network Graphs**: Visualize relationships and interactions, such as social networks or infection spread.



### 4. üîç Measuring Data Similarity and Dissimilarity

Understanding how alike or different data objects are is fundamental in many data mining tasks like clustering, classification, and recommendation.

#### Similarity vs. Dissimilarity

- **Similarity**: A numerical measure of how alike two objects are. Higher values mean more similarity, often normalized between 0 and 1.  
- **Dissimilarity (Distance)**: A numerical measure of how different two objects are. Lower values mean more similarity, with 0 indicating identical objects.

#### Data Matrices

- **Data Matrix**: An n-by-p matrix where n is the number of data objects and p is the number of attributes.  
- **Dissimilarity Matrix**: An n-by-n matrix showing pairwise distances or dissimilarities between data objects.

#### Similarity/Dissimilarity Measures for Different Attribute Types

1. **Nominal Attributes**  
   - Use **simple matching**: count how many attributes match between two objects divided by total attributes.  
   - Alternatively, convert nominal attributes into multiple binary attributes (one-hot encoding).

2. **Binary Attributes**  
   - **Symmetric binary**: Both outcomes equally important (e.g., gender).  
   - **Asymmetric binary**: One outcome more important (e.g., disease presence).  
   - Use **Jaccard coefficient** for asymmetric binary data, which ignores double negatives.

3. **Numeric Attributes**  
   - Use distance measures like **Euclidean distance** (straight-line distance), **Manhattan distance** (sum of absolute differences), or **Minkowski distance** (generalized distance with parameter h).  
   - Normalize numeric data before distance calculation to avoid bias from different scales (e.g., using z-score standardization).

4. **Ordinal Attributes**  
   - Convert ranks to numeric values scaled between 0 and 1, then treat as interval-scaled for distance calculation.

5. **Mixed Attributes**  
   - Combine distances from different attribute types using weighted sums.

#### Cosine Similarity

- Especially useful for high-dimensional data like text documents represented as term-frequency vectors.  
- Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, ranging from 0 (orthogonal, no similarity) to 1 (identical direction).  
- Example: Comparing two documents by their word frequency vectors.



### 5. üìù Summary and Key Takeaways

- Data mining starts with **knowing your data**: understanding data objects, attribute types, and the nature of your dataset.  
- Basic statistical descriptions (mean, median, mode, variance, quartiles) help summarize data and detect outliers.  
- Visualization techniques transform raw data into visual forms that reveal patterns, clusters, and anomalies.  
- Measuring similarity and dissimilarity between data objects is essential for many data mining algorithms. Different attribute types require different distance or similarity measures.  
- These foundational steps are part of **data preprocessing**, a critical phase before applying advanced data mining methods.



This detailed understanding of data and its characteristics sets the stage for effective data mining, enabling better model building, pattern discovery, and decision-making.
