## Study Notes: Time Series Analysis and Mining ‚Äì Part 1 üìà‚è≥



### 1. ‚è∞ What is a Time Series?

A **time series** is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive, usually equally spaced, points in time. For example, daily temperatures, monthly sales, or yearly sunspot counts. Unlike random data points, time series data have an inherent order and temporal dependence, meaning past values can influence future values.

- **Key characteristics:**
  - Values are ordered in time.
  - Typically measured at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly).
  - The mean (average) and standard deviation (spread) of the data can change over time.
  
Understanding time series data is crucial because it allows us to **predict future events** based on historical patterns, which is the core goal of time series forecasting.



### 2. üîç Time Series Analysis, Mining, and Forecasting

- **Time Series Analysis** involves techniques to identify and understand temporal dependencies and patterns in sequential data. It helps answer the question: *What has happened?*

- **Time Series Mining** focuses on extracting meaningful patterns, trends, and anomalies from time series data.

- **Time Series Forecasting** aims to predict future values based on past observations, answering: *What is going to happen next?*

#### Applications of Time Series:
- **Finance:** Stock prices, sales forecasting, inventory management.
- **Weather & Climate:** Temperature trends, rainfall, climate change.
- **Industry:** Equipment maintenance, anomaly detection.
- **Healthcare:** Patient monitoring, disease outbreak prediction.
- **Insurance:** Claims forecasting, benefit analysis.



### 3. üîÑ Dependence and Memory in Time Series

Unlike random variables with fixed distributions, time series data often show **dependence on past values**, known as **memory**.

- **Autocorrelation:** Measures how current values relate to past values at different time lags.
- **Short memory:** Only recent past values influence the current value (e.g., financial data).
- **Long memory:** Distant past values can influence current values (e.g., climate data).

**Stationary time series** often have short memory, while **non-stationary series** tend to have long memory and require more complex models.



### 4. üß© Components of a Time Series

A time series can be thought of as a combination of several components:

- **Level:** The baseline average value of the series.
- **Trend:** The long-term increase or decrease in the data (can be linear or nonlinear).
- **Seasonality:** Regular, repeating short-term cycles (e.g., monthly sales peaks).
- **Cycle:** Longer-term oscillations without a fixed period (e.g., economic recessions).
- **Noise:** Random, unsystematic fluctuations that cannot be explained by the other components.

#### Trend Detection Methods:
- Moving averages smooth out short-term fluctuations.
- Polynomial fitting models nonlinear trends.



### 5. üìä Detecting Seasonality and Cycles

#### Seasonality
Seasonality refers to patterns that repeat at fixed intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles.

- **How to detect seasonality:**
  - **Autocorrelation plots:** Show correlation of the series with its lagged versions. Significant spikes at specific lags indicate seasonality (e.g., lag 12 for yearly seasonality in monthly data).
  - **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** Converts time series into frequency domain to identify dominant seasonal frequencies.
  - **Seasonal decomposition:** Separates the series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

#### Cycles
Cycles are oscillations that occur over longer, irregular periods and are not fixed like seasonality. They often relate to economic or environmental factors.

- **Detecting cycles:**
  - **Spectral analysis:** Identifies dominant frequencies in the data.
  - **Wavelet transform:** Decomposes the series into different frequency bands, useful for non-stationary data.



### 6. üßÆ Decomposing Time Series into Components

Decomposition helps us understand and model the series better by separating it into:

- **Additive model:**  
  \( y(t) = \text{Level} + \text{Trend} + \text{Seasonality} + \text{Noise} \)  
  Used when components add together linearly.

- **Multiplicative model:**  
  \( y(t) = \text{Level} \times \text{Trend} \times \text{Seasonality} \times \text{Noise} \)  
  Used when components interact in a nonlinear way (e.g., seasonal effects increase with trend).

#### STL Decomposition (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS)
- Uses **LOESS** (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing), a non-parametric method that fits smooth curves by weighting nearby points more heavily.
- Steps:
  1. Extract trend by smoothing the series.
  2. Remove trend and extract seasonality.
  3. Calculate residuals (random noise + anomalies).
- STL is flexible and can handle complex seasonal patterns.



### 7. üìâ Stationarity in Time Series

**Stationarity** means the statistical properties of the series (mean, variance, autocorrelation) do not change over time.

- **Stationary series:**  
  - Constant mean and variance.  
  - No trend or seasonality.  
  - Easier to model and forecast.

- **Non-stationary series:**  
  - Changing mean or variance over time.  
  - Presence of trend and/or seasonality.

#### Why stationarity matters:
Many forecasting models assume stationarity. Non-stationary data often need to be transformed before modeling.

#### How to check stationarity:
- **Visual inspection:** Look for trends or changing variance.
- **Seasonal-trend decomposition:** Separate components to assess stationarity.
- **Summary statistics:** Compare mean and variance across different time windows.
- **Statistical tests:**  
  - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is commonly used to test for stationarity.



### 8. üîß Fixing Non-Stationarity: Transformations and Differencing

To make a time series stationary, we often apply transformations:

#### Fixing non-constant variance:
- **Logarithmic transform:** Reduces exponential growth effects.
- **Square root transform:** Useful for moderate growth trends.
- **Box-Cox transform:** A flexible family of power transforms that includes log and square root.

#### Removing trend:
- **Differencing:** Replace each value by the difference between it and the previous value.  
  - First-order differencing: \( y'_t = y_t - y_{t-1} \)  
  - Second-order differencing: Difference of the first differences.

#### Combining both:
- Apply Box-Cox transform to stabilize variance.
- Then apply differencing to remove trend.

These steps help prepare the data for modeling by stabilizing its statistical properties.



### 9. üß™ Practical Tools and Examples

- **Python packages:**  
  - `statsmodels` for decomposition and stationarity tests.  
  - `pandas` for data handling.  
  - `scipy` for Box-Cox transformations.

- **Example workflow:**  
  1. Load time series data (e.g., airline passengers).  
  2. Visualize and check for trend and seasonality.  
  3. Decompose using STL or classical methods.  
  4. Test stationarity with ADF test.  
  5. Apply transformations (log, Box-Cox) and differencing as needed.  
  6. Re-check stationarity and proceed to modeling.



## Summary

Time series analysis is about understanding data that changes over time. It involves identifying patterns like trends, seasonality, and cycles, and separating these from noise. Stationarity is a key concept that affects how we model and forecast time series. Various techniques, including decomposition, autocorrelation, and transformations, help us prepare and analyze time series data effectively.
