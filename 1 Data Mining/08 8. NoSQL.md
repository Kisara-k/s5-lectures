## 8. NoSQL

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized, and clear study note based on your lecture content about NoSQL databases. I‚Äôve expanded explanations, clarified key concepts, and structured the note with numbered emoji headings for easy navigation.



## 1. üìö Introduction to NoSQL Databases

In the world of data management, **NoSQL databases** have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional relational databases (RDBMS). The term **NoSQL** stands for **‚ÄúNot Only SQL‚Äù** or sometimes interpreted as **‚ÄúNo SQL‚Äù**, but it‚Äôs important to understand that NoSQL databases are not simply rejecting SQL outright. Instead, they represent a broad category of database systems that do **not** follow the strict relational model used by SQL databases.

The name NoSQL was coined during a meetup of developers working on new types of databases that didn‚Äôt fit the relational mold. While ‚ÄúNon-Relational Databases‚Äù might be a more accurate term, it‚Äôs a bit cumbersome, so NoSQL stuck and became widely adopted. Over time, NoSQL has grown into a major movement with conferences, mailing lists, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem.



## 2. üîç Why NoSQL? Understanding the Trends Driving Its Popularity

NoSQL databases arose to address several key challenges and trends that traditional SQL databases struggle with:

#### Trend 1: Massive Data Size  
Modern applications generate and need to store **huge volumes of data**‚Äîfar beyond what traditional databases were designed to handle. Think of companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, which manage data across tens of thousands of servers.

#### Trend 2: Connectedness  
Data today is highly interconnected and complex. Traditional relational models struggle to efficiently represent and query highly connected data at scale.

#### Trend 3: Semi-structured and Individualized Content  
Unlike the rigid, fixed schemas of the past (e.g., salary lists with fixed job columns), modern data is often **semi-structured** or **schema-less**. For example, user profiles on social media might have wildly different attributes, and the schema can evolve over time without downtime or complex migrations.

#### Trend 4: Architectural Limitations of RDBMS  
Relational databases were designed for transactional systems with strong consistency and complex queries. However, modern web applications prioritize:

- **Low and predictable latency** (fast response times)
- **Scalability and elasticity** (ability to grow/shrink resources on demand)
- **High availability** (systems stay online despite failures)
- **Flexible schemas** (to handle semi-structured data)
- **Geographic distribution** (data centers worldwide)

Traditional ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions don‚Äôt scale well in distributed environments, which is why NoSQL databases often relax some of these guarantees.



## 3. ‚öñÔ∏è Comparing SQL and NoSQL: Characteristics and Trade-offs

#### SQL Databases:  
- Store data in **tables and columns** with fixed schemas.
- Use **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- Use **Data Definition Language (DDL)** to define schemas and constraints (primary keys, foreign keys).
- Support **ACID transactions** ensuring strong consistency and integrity.
- Abstract the physical storage layer, allowing query optimization and indexing.
- Designed for complex queries and joins.

#### NoSQL Databases:  
- Often **schema-less** or have flexible schemas.
- Designed for **horizontal scalability** across many servers.
- Prioritize **availability and partition tolerance** over strict consistency (see CAP theorem).
- Use **BASE** properties instead of ACID:
  - **Basically Available**: System guarantees availability.
  - **Soft state**: System state may change over time without input.
  - **Eventually consistent**: Data will become consistent over time.
- Typically have **limited query capabilities** compared to SQL.
- Often use **key-value, document, column, or graph data models** instead of tables.



## 4. üß© The CAP Theorem and BASE Model: Understanding Distributed Systems

The **CAP theorem**, formulated by Eric Brewer and Nancy Lynch, states that a distributed system can only guarantee two of the following three properties simultaneously:

- **Consistency (C):** All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- **Availability (A):** Every request receives a response, even if some nodes fail.
- **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate despite network partitions or message loss.

NoSQL databases often choose **Availability and Partition Tolerance** over strict Consistency, leading to the **BASE** model:

- **Basically Available:** The system is always available to respond.
- **Soft State:** The system‚Äôs state can change over time, even without new input.
- **Eventually Consistent:** Data updates propagate asynchronously, so temporary inconsistencies are allowed but resolved eventually.

This contrasts with the **ACID** model of SQL databases, which prioritizes strong consistency and transactional integrity.



## 5. üóÉÔ∏è Types of NoSQL Databases and Their Use Cases

NoSQL databases come in several types, each optimized for different data models and use cases:

#### 1. Column Store Databases  
- Store data by columns rather than rows.
- Efficient for queries that access only a few columns of many rows.
- Examples: **Google BigTable**, **HBase**, **Ingres VectorWise**.
- Used in big data and analytics where columnar compression and fast reads are important.

#### 2. Document Store Databases  
- Store data as documents, usually in JSON or BSON format.
- Schema-less, allowing flexible and nested data structures.
- Examples: **CouchDB**, **MongoDB**.
- Ideal for content management, user profiles, and applications needing flexible schemas.

#### 3. Key-Value Stores  
- Store data as simple key-value pairs, like a hash table.
- Very fast for lookups by key but limited query capabilities.
- Examples: **Amazon Dynamo**, **Project Voldemort**, **MemCacheDB**.
- Used for caching, session management, and simple data retrieval.

#### Other Types  
- **Graph Databases:** Optimized for highly connected data (e.g., social networks).
- **XML Databases:** Store and query XML documents.
- **Object-Oriented Databases:** Store objects directly.
- **Codasyl Databases:** Older network database model.



## 6. üèóÔ∏è Deep Dive: Google BigTable (Column Store Example)

Google BigTable is a pioneering column store database designed for massive scalability:

- Data is stored as a **sparse, distributed, persistent multidimensional sorted map**.
- Keys are strings, and data is organized by **row key**, **column key**, and **timestamp**.
- Supports **versioning**: multiple versions of a cell can be stored and managed.
- Uses a **single master server** to assign tablets (partitions) to many tablet servers.
- Tablets are ranges of rows, allowing efficient range scans.
- Data is stored on Google File System (GFS) and uses **Chubby**, a distributed lock service.
- Designed for high throughput and low latency at massive scale.



## 7. üìÑ Document Store Example: CouchDB

CouchDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database:

- Stores data as **JSON documents** with flexible, schema-less structure.
- Uses **B-tree storage** and **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** to avoid locking.
- Supports **incremental replication** for distributed setups.
- Documents have unique IDs (`_id`) and revision numbers (`_rev`) for versioning.
- No joins or foreign keys; relationships are handled at the application level.
- Uses **MapReduce** for indexing and querying large datasets.

Example JSON document in CouchDB:

```json
{
  "_id": "unique-guid",
  "_rev": "314159",
  "type": "abstract",
  "author": "Keith W. Hare",
  "title": "SQL Standard and NoSQL Databases",
  "body": "NoSQL databases are a hot topic...",
  "creation_timestamp": "2011/05/10 13:30:00 +0004"
}
```



## 8. üîë Key-Value Store Example: Amazon Dynamo

Amazon Dynamo is a distributed key-value store designed for high availability and scalability:

- Uses **consistent hashing** to distribute data evenly across nodes.
- Supports **object versioning** to handle concurrent updates.
- Uses **gossip protocols** for membership and failure detection.
- Implements **quorum reads and writes** to balance consistency and availability.
- Designed for simple queries (key-based lookups) and eventual consistency.
- Powers core Amazon services requiring low latency and high throughput.



## 9. ‚öôÔ∏è Querying and Data Manipulation in NoSQL

Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL systems often lack a standardized query language. Instead:

- Data manipulation and retrieval are done through **procedural APIs** in languages like Java, JavaScript, or Python.
- Queries are often **key-based** or use **MapReduce** for aggregation and indexing.
- NoSQL databases prioritize **fast, predictable responses** over complex query capabilities.
- Schema changes are easier to manage because of flexible or schema-less designs.
- Applications often handle consistency and data integrity logic that SQL databases enforce automatically.



## 10. ‚úÖ Advantages and Disadvantages of NoSQL

#### Advantages  
- **Massive scalability:** Can handle huge data volumes across many servers.
- **High availability:** Designed to stay online despite failures.
- **Lower cost:** Commodity hardware and open-source software reduce expenses.
- **Schema flexibility:** Easily handle semi-structured or evolving data.
- **Elasticity:** Scale resources up or down as needed.

#### Disadvantages  
- **Limited query capabilities:** No complex joins or rich query languages.

- **More complex client logic:** Applications must handle some data integrity.
- **Lack of standardization:** Different NoSQL systems have different APIs and query methods.
- **Portability issues:** Migrating between NoSQL systems can be difficult.
- **Access control:** Often less mature security models compared to SQL.



## 11. üìà Summary and Current Landscape

NoSQL databases have become essential for modern web-scale applications that require:

- Handling **big data** and distributed architectures.
- Flexible, evolving data models.
- High availability and fault tolerance.
- Fast, scalable performance.

Many traditional relational database vendors have incorporated NoSQL features to stay competitive, reflecting the hybrid nature of today‚Äôs data management needs.
