## Study Notes

### 1. üöÄ The NoSQL Movement: Why NoSQL?

The NoSQL movement emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional relational databases, especially when dealing with modern applications that require high scalability, flexibility, and performance. Here‚Äôs why NoSQL databases became popular:

- **Need for Greater Scalability:** Traditional relational databases often struggle to scale horizontally (across many servers). NoSQL databases are designed to scale out easily, handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads.
  
- **Throughput and Response Time:** Applications today demand fast read/write operations and low latency. NoSQL systems optimize for these performance metrics.
  
- **More Expressive Data Models and Schema Flexibility:** Unlike rigid relational schemas, NoSQL databases allow flexible or even schema-less data models. This flexibility helps developers evolve their data structures without costly migrations.
  
- **Object-Relational Mismatch:** Object-oriented programming languages don‚Äôt map neatly to relational tables. NoSQL databases often use document, key-value, or graph models that align better with application data structures.
  
- **Preference for Open-Source Software:** Many NoSQL systems are open-source, encouraging community contributions and adoption.


### 2. üî• Firestore: A Serverless Document Database

Firestore is a NoSQL document database developed by Google, designed for modern applications like mobile, web, and IoT. It is fully managed and serverless, meaning developers don‚Äôt worry about infrastructure.

#### Key Features of Firestore:

- **Distributed System:** Firestore is built on a distributed architecture, ensuring data is replicated and available globally.
  
- **Serverless:** No need to manage servers or clusters; Google Cloud handles scaling and maintenance.
  
- **Simple APIs:** Easy-to-use APIs for reading and writing data.
  
- **ACID Transactions:** Supports atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable transactions, backed by Google Spanner technology.
  
- **Document Model:** Data is stored as documents, which are collections of key-value pairs.
  
- **Change Data Capture:** Firestore can track changes to documents, useful for real-time updates.
  
- **Cost and Limits:** Runs only on Google Cloud, with write throughput limits (up to 10,000 writes per second).

#### Firestore‚Äôs Document Model Explained:

- A **document** is a set of typed key-value pairs. Keys are strings, and values can be primitive types (string, number, boolean, timestamp) or complex types (arrays, maps, geopoints).
  
- Documents are grouped into **collections**. Collections contain documents of the same conceptual type but documents can have different schemas.
  
- Each document has a **unique string identifier**.
  
- Firestore supports **hierarchical data** through **subcollections**, which are collections nested inside documents. Subcollections can be nested up to 100 levels deep.

#### Writing Data in Firestore:

- **Single Document Write:** Use the `set` method to convert a Python dictionary into a Firestore document.
  
- **Nested Documents:** Subcollections allow storing related data hierarchically.
  
- **Batch Writes:** You can write multiple documents in batches (up to 500 documents per batch), even across different collections.

#### Reading Data:

- **Single Document:** Use `get` to fetch one document.
  
- **Multiple Documents:** Use `stream` to fetch all documents in a collection or subcollection.
  
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Use `where` to filter, `order_by` to sort, and `limit` to restrict the number of results.
  
- **Indexes:** All queries require indexes; if an index is missing, the query will fail.

#### Updating and Deleting:

- Use `update` to modify fields in a document.
  
- Use `firestore.Increment()` to atomically increment numeric fields.
  
- Use `firestore.DELETE_FIELD` to remove a field.
  
- Use `delete()` to remove entire documents.

#### Data Modeling in Firestore:

- Identify **access patterns** (how the data will be queried).
  
- Group entities into hierarchies: top-level entities become collections, and related entities become subcollections.
  
- Use primary keys or concatenated keys as unique document IDs.
  
- Example: Converting a college relational schema into Firestore involves creating collections for classes, students, and instructors, with subcollections for nested relationships.


### 3. üçÉ MongoDB: Flexible Document Store

MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database designed for web-scale applications. It uses a document-oriented model and supports rich queries.

#### The CAP Theorem Context:

- The CAP theorem states that a distributed database can only guarantee two of the following three at the same time: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.
  
- MongoDB balances these properties to provide high availability and partition tolerance, with tunable consistency.

#### MongoDB Overview:

- **Distributed System:** Supports replication and sharding for scalability and fault tolerance.
  
- **Open Source:** Sponsored by MongoDB Inc., widely used in industry.
  
- **Document Model:** Stores data as BSON (Binary JSON) documents, which are flexible and can nest objects and arrays.
  
- **Schemaless:** MongoDB does not enforce a schema on writes; schema is applied when reading (schema-on-read).
  
- **Rich Query Language:** Supports complex queries, including nested queries, boolean operators, and range queries.
  
- **Secondary Indexes:** Supports indexes on any field to speed up queries.
  
- **Transactions:** Supports multi-document ACID transactions.
  
- **Sharding:** Data is partitioned across shards based on a shard key, which determines how documents are distributed.
  
- **Replication:** Replica sets provide high availability with automatic failover and load balancing.

#### MongoDB Data Model:

- Documents are BSON objects with unordered key-value pairs.
  
- Each document has a unique `_id` field.
  
- Supports various data types: strings, integers, doubles, booleans, dates, arrays, nested objects, and ObjectIds.
  
- Documents are grouped into collections, which are grouped into databases.

#### Basic Operations:

- **Inserts:** `insertOne()`, `insertMany()` to add documents.
  
- **Reads:** `findOne()`, `find()` with selection (filter) and projection (fields to return).
  
- **Updates:** `update()`, `updateMany()` to modify documents.
  
- **Deletes:** `deleteOne()`, `deleteMany()` to remove documents.

#### Query Examples:

- Nested queries can filter on fields inside embedded documents.
  
- Boolean operators like `$and` combine multiple conditions.
  
- Range queries use operators like `$lte` (less than or equal), `$gte` (greater than or equal).


### 4. üåê Neo4j: Graph Database for Connected Data

Neo4j is a graph database designed to store and query highly connected data efficiently. It uses a labeled property graph model.

#### What is a Labeled Property Graph?

- Nodes (entities) and relationships (edges) both have labels and properties (key-value pairs).
  
- This model is ideal for data where relationships are first-class citizens, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and access control.

#### Neo4j Features:

- **Declarative Query Language (Cypher):** Similar to SQL but designed for graph traversal and pattern matching.
  
- **Open Source:** Sponsored by Neo4j Inc.
  
- **ACID Transactions:** Ensures data integrity.
  
- **Distributed Architecture:** Scales reads across multiple servers.
  
- **Visualization Tools:** Neo4j Browser and Bloom help visualize graph data.
  
- **Cloud Offering:** Neo4j Aura provides managed cloud service.
  
- **Write Scalability:** Limited compared to reads; no sharding support.

#### Basic Cypher Commands:

- `CREATE` to add nodes and relationships.
  
- `MATCH` to find patterns in the graph.
  
- `RETURN` to output query results.
  
- Example: Creating a person node and a place node, then linking them with a `LIVES_IN` relationship.

#### Example: IAM Model in Neo4j

- Nodes represent entities like Person, Role, Group, Permission.
  
- Relationships represent connections like `HAS_ROLE`, `IN_GROUP`, `HAS_PERMISSION`.
  
- Example Cypher queries create nodes and relationships, then query permissions for a person by traversing these relationships.
  
- This model is powerful for access control systems where permissions depend on roles and group memberships.

#### Updating and Deleting in Neo4j:

- Add or update node properties and labels.
  
- Modify relationships and their properties.
  
- Delete relationships before deleting nodes to maintain graph integrity.
  
- Commands exist to drop all nodes and relationships if needed.
