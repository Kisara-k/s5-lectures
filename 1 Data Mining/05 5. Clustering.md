## Study Notes on Clustering üìä



### 1. üß© Introduction to Cluster Analysis: Basic Concepts

Cluster analysis is a fundamental technique in data mining and machine learning used to group a set of data objects into subsets called **clusters**. The goal is to ensure that objects within the same cluster are **similar** to each other, while objects in different clusters are **dissimilar**.

- **What is a Cluster?**  
  A cluster is a collection of data points that share common characteristics or are related in some way. For example, in a customer database, a cluster might represent a group of customers with similar buying habits.

- **What is Cluster Analysis?**  
  Cluster analysis (also called clustering or data segmentation) is the process of partitioning data into groups such that similar objects are grouped together, and dissimilar objects are separated. This is an **unsupervised learning** technique, meaning it does not rely on predefined labels or classes but learns patterns from the data itself.

- **Why Use Clustering?**  
  Clustering helps in understanding the structure of data and is widely used in various fields:
  - **Biology:** Classifying species into taxonomic groups.
  - **Information Retrieval:** Grouping similar documents.
  - **Land Use:** Identifying regions with similar land characteristics.
  - **Marketing:** Segmenting customers for targeted campaigns.
  - **City Planning:** Grouping houses by type or location.
  - **Earthquake Studies:** Clustering epicenters along fault lines.

- **Clustering as a Preprocessing Tool:**  
  Clustering can also be used before applying other algorithms to:
  - Summarize data for regression or classification.
  - Compress data (e.g., image vector quantization).
  - Detect outliers (points far from any cluster).
  - Localize search or nearest neighbor queries.

- **What Makes a Good Clustering?**  
  A good clustering method produces:
  - **High intra-cluster similarity:** Objects in the same cluster are very similar.
  - **Low inter-cluster similarity:** Clusters are well separated and distinct.

- **Measuring Similarity:**  
  Similarity is often measured using a **distance function** (e.g., Euclidean distance). Different types of data (numerical, categorical, ordinal) require different distance measures. Weights can be assigned to variables based on their importance.

- **Challenges in Clustering:**  
  - Choosing the right similarity measure.
  - Handling different data types.
  - Scalability to large datasets.
  - Discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes.
  - Dealing with noise and outliers.
  - Handling high-dimensional data.
  - Incorporating user constraints or domain knowledge.



### 2. üî¢ Partitioning Methods

Partitioning methods divide the dataset into a predefined number of clusters, **k**, optimizing a criterion such as minimizing the sum of squared distances within clusters.

- **Basic Idea:**  
  Given a dataset of n objects and a number k, partition the data into k clusters to minimize the total distance between objects and their cluster centers.

- **Global Optimal vs. Heuristics:**  
  Finding the global optimal partition is computationally expensive (exhaustive search). Instead, heuristic algorithms like **k-means** and **k-medoids** are commonly used.

#### K-Means Algorithm

- **How it works:**  
  1. Initialize k centroids (seed points).
  2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
  3. Recalculate centroids as the mean of points in each cluster.
  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until assignments no longer change.

- **Strengths:**  
  - Efficient with time complexity O(tkn), where t is iterations, k is clusters, and n is data points.
  - Works well for numerical data in continuous space.

- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Sensitive to outliers (extreme values distort centroids).
  - Requires specifying k in advance.
  - Assumes clusters are convex and spherical.
  - Not suitable for categorical data.

#### K-Medoids (PAM - Partitioning Around Medoids)

- Instead of using the mean, k-medoids uses actual data points (medoids) as cluster centers, making it more robust to noise and outliers.
- Works with various data types, including categorical.
- More computationally expensive than k-means.
- Variants like **CLARA** and **CLARANS** improve scalability by sampling.

#### Variations of K-Means

- **K-modes:** For categorical data, replaces means with modes.
- **K-prototypes:** Handles mixed numerical and categorical data.
- Different initialization and distance calculation strategies exist to improve performance.



### 3. üå≥ Hierarchical Clustering Methods

Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) representing nested groupings of data points.

- **Two Types:**
  - **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up):** Start with each object as a single cluster and iteratively merge the closest clusters.
  - **Divisive (Top-Down):** Start with all objects in one cluster and recursively split them.

- **No need to specify k upfront**, but a stopping criterion or dendrogram cut-off is required.

#### Distance Between Clusters

- **Single Link:** Minimum distance between any two points in different clusters.
- **Complete Link:** Maximum distance between any two points in different clusters.
- **Average Link:** Average distance between all pairs of points in different clusters.
- **Centroid Link:** Distance between cluster centroids.
- **Medoid Link:** Distance between cluster medoids.

#### Cluster Properties

- **Centroid:** The mean point of a cluster.
- **Radius:** Average distance from points to centroid.
- **Diameter:** Average distance between all pairs of points in the cluster.

#### Limitations

- Agglomerative methods cannot undo merges.
- Computationally expensive (O(n¬≤) or worse).
- Sensitive to noise and outliers.

#### Advanced Hierarchical Methods

- **BIRCH:** Builds a CF-tree (Clustering Feature tree) to incrementally cluster large datasets efficiently.
- **CHAMELEON:** Uses dynamic modeling and graph partitioning to merge clusters based on interconnectivity and closeness.
- **Probabilistic Hierarchical Clustering:** Uses statistical models (e.g., Gaussian) to measure cluster similarity and handle missing data.



### 4. üåê Density-Based Clustering Methods

Density-based methods define clusters as areas of high point density separated by areas of low density. They are powerful for discovering clusters of arbitrary shape and handling noise.

#### Key Concepts

- **Eps (Œµ):** Radius defining the neighborhood around a point.
- **MinPts:** Minimum number of points required in the Eps-neighborhood to form a dense region.
- **Core Point:** A point with at least MinPts neighbors within Eps.
- **Directly Density-Reachable:** A point p is directly density-reachable from q if p is in q‚Äôs Eps-neighborhood and q is a core point.
- **Density-Reachable:** A point p is density-reachable from q if there is a chain of points connecting q to p via direct density reachability.
- **Density-Connected:** Two points are density-connected if they are both density-reachable from a common core point.

#### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

- Clusters are maximal sets of density-connected points.
- Can find clusters of arbitrary shape.
- Handles noise by labeling points not belonging to any cluster as noise.
- Sensitive to parameters Eps and MinPts.

#### OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure)

- Produces an ordering of points reflecting the density-based clustering structure.
- Can identify clusters at multiple density levels without fixing Eps.
- Uses concepts of **core distance** and **reachability distance**.
- More flexible than DBSCAN but more complex.

#### DENCLUE (DENsity-based CLUstEring)

- Uses mathematical density functions to model data distribution.
- Defines clusters based on **density attractors** (local maxima of density).
- Can handle noise and arbitrary shapes.
- More mathematically rigorous and faster than DBSCAN.
- Uses influence functions to calculate overall density.



### 5. üó∫Ô∏è Grid-Based Clustering Methods

Grid-based methods divide the data space into a finite number of cells forming a grid structure and perform clustering on this grid.

- Advantages: Fast, scalable, and efficient for large datasets.
- Disadvantages: Cluster boundaries are axis-aligned (horizontal/vertical), limiting detection of arbitrary shapes.

#### STING (Statistical Information Grid)

- Divides space into hierarchical rectangular cells.
- Stores statistical summaries (count, mean, std deviation) for each cell.
- Uses a top-down approach to refine clusters.
- Efficient and parallelizable.

#### CLIQUE (Clustering In QUEst)

- Designed for high-dimensional data.
- Combines grid-based and density-based approaches.
- Automatically finds subspaces with dense clusters.
- Uses the Apriori principle to prune search space.
- Clusters are formed by connected dense cells.
- Scales well with dimensionality but sensitive to grid size and density thresholds.



### 6. üìè Evaluation of Clustering

Evaluating clustering quality is crucial but challenging because clustering is unsupervised.

#### Assessing Clustering Tendency

- **Hopkins Statistic:** Measures if data is uniformly distributed or has cluster structure.
  - Values close to 0.5 indicate randomness.
  - Values close to 0 indicate clustering tendency.

#### Determining Number of Clusters

- **Empirical Rule:** Number of clusters ‚âà ‚àön/2 for n data points.
- **Elbow Method:** Plot sum of squared errors vs. number of clusters and look for a "knee" point.
- **Cross-Validation:** Split data, train on subsets, and test clustering quality on held-out data.

#### Measuring Clustering Quality

- **Extrinsic Methods:** Use ground truth labels to measure:
  - Homogeneity: Clusters contain only members of a single class.
  - Completeness: All members of a class are assigned to the same cluster.
  - Rag Bag: Penalize mixing heterogeneous objects.
  - Small Cluster Preservation: Avoid splitting small true clusters.

- **Intrinsic Methods:** Use internal criteria without ground truth:
  - Silhouette Coefficient: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
  - Other metrics consider cluster compactness and separation.



### 7. üìù Summary and Outlook

Clustering is a versatile and powerful tool for exploratory data analysis and preprocessing. Different clustering methods suit different data types, shapes, and applications:

- **Partitioning methods** are simple and efficient but require specifying the number of clusters and assume convex shapes.
- **Hierarchical methods** provide a rich structure but can be computationally expensive.
- **Density-based methods** excel at finding arbitrarily shaped clusters and handling noise.
- **Grid-based methods** are fast and scalable, especially for large or high-dimensional data.

Choosing the right method depends on the data characteristics, the problem domain, and the goals of the analysis. Evaluation and validation remain critical to ensure meaningful clustering results.
