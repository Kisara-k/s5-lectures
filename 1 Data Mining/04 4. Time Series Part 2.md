Certainly! Below is a **detailed, well-organized, and clear study note** based on your lecture content on **Time Series Part 2**. I have expanded explanations, clarified key concepts, and structured the note with numbered emoji headings for easy navigation.



## Study Notes: Time Series Part 2 üìà



### 1. üîÑ Understanding Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation

When working with time series data, understanding how observations relate to each other over time is crucial. Two important concepts here are **autocorrelation** and **partial autocorrelation**.

#### What is Correlation?

Correlation measures how two variables move together linearly. If one variable increases and the other tends to increase at a constant rate, they have a positive correlation. If one increases while the other decreases, they have a negative correlation.

#### Autocorrelation (ACF)

Autocorrelation measures the correlation of a time series with a lagged version of itself. In simpler terms, it tells us how the value at one time point relates to values at previous time points.

- **Example:** The temperature today might be correlated with the temperature yesterday.
- The **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** plot shows these correlations for different lags (time steps back).
- It includes both **direct** and **indirect** dependencies (e.g., today‚Äôs value relates to yesterday‚Äôs, and yesterday‚Äôs relates to the day before, so today indirectly relates to the day before yesterday).

**How to calculate ACF?**  
For a lag \( k \), ACF is the correlation between the series \( X_t \) and \( X_{t-k} \).

#### Partial Autocorrelation (PACF)

PACF measures the **direct** relationship between an observation and its lag, removing the effects of intermediate lags.

- For example, PACF at lag 2 measures the correlation between \( X_t \) and \( X_{t-2} \) after removing the effect of \( X_{t-1} \).
- It is calculated by fitting a linear regression model where \( X_t \) is regressed on all lags up to \( k \), and the coefficient of the \( k^{th} \) lag is the PACF.



### 2. üßÆ Time Series Forecasting Models

Forecasting means predicting future values based on past data. There are many models, each with different assumptions and complexities.

#### Traditional Univariate Models

These models use only one variable (the time series itself) to forecast future values.

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** Combines autoregression (AR), differencing (I for integration to remove trends), and moving average (MA) components.
- **SARIMAX:** Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables.
- **Prophet and Neural Prophet:** Modern forecasting tools that handle seasonality and trends well.

#### Multivariate Models

These models use multiple variables to improve forecasting accuracy.

- **Vector AutoRegression (VAR):** Models multiple time series together, capturing their interdependencies.

#### Machine Learning Models

- Neural networks, CatBoost regressors, and other regressors can be used for forecasting, especially when relationships are complex and non-linear.



### 3. üìä Simple Forecasting Methods

Before diving into complex models, simple methods provide useful baselines:

- **Average Method:** Forecast future values as the average of past observations.
- **Naive Method:** Forecast future values as the last observed value.
- **Seasonal Naive Method:** Forecast future values as the last observed value from the same season (e.g., same month last year).
- **Drift Method:** Forecasts based on a linear trend estimated from the data.

These methods are simple but important for benchmarking.



### 4. ‚ú® Exponential Smoothing Methods

Exponential smoothing methods forecast by weighting past observations, giving more importance to recent data.

- **Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES):** Suitable for data without trend or seasonality. Weights decline exponentially for older data.
- **Double Exponential Smoothing (Holt‚Äôs method):** Accounts for level and trend.
- **Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters):** Accounts for level, trend, and seasonality.

**Key idea:** Recent observations influence the forecast more than older ones, but the method adapts to trends and seasonal patterns when extended.



### 5. üîÑ Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) Models

#### Autoregressive Model (AR)

- Uses past values of the series to predict the current value.
- For example, an AR(2) model predicts \( X_t \) using \( X_{t-1} \) and \( X_{t-2} \).
- The model assumes the series depends linearly on its own previous values plus some noise.

#### Moving Average Model (MA)

- Uses past forecast errors (noise terms) to predict the current value.
- For example, an MA(3) model uses errors from the last 3 time points.
- This helps smooth out random fluctuations.

#### ARMA Model

- Combines AR and MA components.
- Useful for stationary time series (no trend or seasonality).



### 6. üîÑ Integrated Models: ARIMA and SARIMA

#### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

- Extends ARMA by including **differencing** to remove trends and make the series stationary.
- Parameters:  
  - \( p \): number of AR terms  
  - \( d \): degree of differencing  
  - \( q \): number of MA terms

#### SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

- Extends ARIMA to handle seasonality.
- Adds seasonal parameters \( P, D, Q \) and seasonal period \( m \).
- Example: SARIMA(2,1,3)(1,1,2)\(_{12}\) means:  
  - AR(2), differencing 1, MA(3)  
  - Seasonal AR(1), seasonal differencing 1, seasonal MA(2) with season length 12 (e.g., months)



### 7. üß™ Model Evaluation and Selection

Choosing the best forecasting model involves:

- **Residual Analysis:** Check residuals (errors) for randomness (white noise). Use ACF and PACF plots of residuals.
- **Information Criteria:**  
  - **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)** and **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)** balance model fit and complexity.  
  - Lower AIC/BIC values indicate better models.
- **Error Metrics:** Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) on validation/test data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use grid search or automated methods to find the best model parameters.



### 8. üîç Time Series Mining Tasks

Time series mining involves extracting useful patterns and knowledge from time series data.

#### Key Tasks:

- **Indexing:** Efficiently searching for similar time series or subsequences in large databases.
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar time series together.
- **Classification:** Assigning labels to time series based on their patterns.
- **Prediction:** Forecasting future values.
- **Summarization:** Creating concise descriptions or visualizations of large time series datasets.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual or unexpected patterns.
- **Segmentation:** Dividing time series into meaningful segments.



### 9. üóúÔ∏è Time Series Compression and Similarity Measures

#### Compression

- Reduces storage and speeds up mining.
- Techniques include **delta encoding** (storing differences between values) and **run-length encoding** (storing repeated values efficiently).

#### Similarity Measures

- Measure how alike two time series are.
- **Euclidean Distance:** Straight-line distance between two sequences of equal length.
- **Lp Norms:** Generalized distance measures (e.g., Manhattan distance).
- **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW):** Allows flexible alignment of sequences that may be out of phase or have different speeds (e.g., speech signals).
- **Longest Common Subsequence:** Measures similarity based on shared subsequences.
- **Probabilistic Measures:** Use statistical models to estimate similarity.



### 10. üîé Motifs, Matrix Profile, Discords, and Anomalies

#### Motifs

- Repeated patterns or subsequences in time series data.
- Useful for understanding common behaviors.

#### Matrix Profile

- A powerful data structure that stores the similarity between all subsequences in a time series.
- Helps quickly find motifs (repeated patterns) and discords (anomalies).
- Large values in the matrix profile indicate anomalies or unusual events.
- Efficient, scalable, and supports streaming data.

#### Discords

- The most unusual or anomalous subsequences in the data.
- Important for anomaly detection.



### 11. üñºÔ∏è Time Series Representations

Representing time series data effectively is important for mining and forecasting.

- Raw data can be high-dimensional and noisy.
- Common representations include:
  - **Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA)**
  - **Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX)**
  - **Fourier and Wavelet transforms**
- These reduce dimensionality and highlight important features.
