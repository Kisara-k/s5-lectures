## Study Notes

### 1. üìä What is Data Mining and Why Is It Important?

#### Introduction  
Data mining is the process of discovering useful, interesting, and previously unknown patterns or knowledge from large amounts of data. In today‚Äôs world, data is growing explosively‚Äîfrom terabytes to petabytes‚Äîdue to automated data collection, the internet, and digital technologies. Despite having so much data, organizations and individuals often struggle to extract meaningful insights. This is where data mining comes in: it helps transform raw data into valuable knowledge that can support decision-making, scientific discovery, and business intelligence.

#### Why Data Mining?  
- **Data Explosion:** We live in a data-rich world with sources like e-commerce transactions, social media, scientific experiments, and sensor networks generating massive datasets continuously.  
- **Knowledge Starvation:** Although data is abundant, useful knowledge is scarce. Data mining automates the analysis of these massive datasets to find hidden patterns.  
- **Evolution of Science:** Historically, science evolved from empirical (observation-based) to theoretical (model-based), then computational (simulation-based), and now to data-driven science, where data mining plays a crucial role.  
- **Database Technology Evolution:** Data mining is a natural progression from traditional database management, data warehousing, and online analytical processing (OLAP), focusing on extracting knowledge rather than just storing data.


### 2. üîç What Exactly is Data Mining?

#### Defining Data Mining  
Data mining, also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), is the automated extraction of patterns that are:  
- **Interesting:** Non-trivial and useful for decision-making.  
- **Implicit:** Not obvious or explicitly stored in the data.  
- **Previously Unknown:** New insights that were not known before.  

#### Common Misconceptions  
- Data mining is not just simple querying or searching.  
- It is different from deductive expert systems that rely on predefined rules.  
- It involves inductive learning‚Äîdiscovering patterns from data without prior knowledge.

#### Alternative Names  
- Knowledge discovery  
- Data/pattern analysis  
- Information harvesting  
- Business intelligence
