       "### 1. 🧮 Functions of a Complex Variable: Understanding the Basics\n",
       "\n",
       "When we talk about functions of a complex variable, we are dealing with functions where the input and output are complex numbers. A complex number is usually written as $ z = x + iy $, where $ x $ and $ y $ are real numbers, and $ i $ is the imaginary unit with the property $ i^2 = -1 $.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### What is a function of a complex variable?\n",
       "\n",
       "A function $ f $ defined on a set $ S $ of complex numbers assigns to each complex number $ z \\in S $ another complex number $ \\omega $. We write this as:\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\\omega = f(z).\n",
       "$$\n",
       "Here, $ S $ is called the **domain** of the function, and the value $ \\omega $ is the **image** of $ z $ under $ f $.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Expressing complex functions in terms of real variables\n",
       "\n",
       "Since $ z = x + iy $ and $ \\omega = u + iv $, where $ u $ and $ v $ are real numbers, the function $ f $ can be split into two real-valued functions:\n",
       "$$\n",
       "f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y).\n",
       "$$\n",
       "This means the output depends on two real variables $ x $ and $ y $, and the function $ f $ can be thought of as a pair of real functions $ u $ and $ v $.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Using polar coordinates\n",
       "\n",
       "Instead of Cartesian coordinates $ (x, y) $, we can use polar coordinates $ (r, \\theta) $, where:\n",
       "$$\n",
       "z = r e^{i\\theta}, \\quad r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\quad \\theta = \\tan^{-1}(y/x).\n",
       "$$\n",
       "In this form, the function becomes:\n",
       "$$\n",
       "f(z) = u(r, \\theta) + i v(r, \\theta).\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Examples to illustrate\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Example 1:** Write $ f(z) = z^3 + z + 1 $ in terms of $ u(x,y) $ and $ v(x,y) $.\n",
       "- **Example 2:** Given $ f(z) = x^2 - y^2 - 2y + i(2x - 2xy) $, express $ f(z) $ in terms of $ z $ and $ \\overline{z} $ (the complex conjugate of $ z $).\n",
       "- **Example 3:** Write $ f(z) = z + \\overline{z} $ (for $ z \\neq 0 $) in polar form $ u(r, \\theta) + i v(r, \\theta) $.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Mapping and transformations\n",
       "\n",
       "A function $ f $ can also be called a **mapping** or **transformation** because it \"maps\" points from the $ z $-plane to the $ \\omega $-plane. Some common geometric transformations include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Translation:** $ \\omega = z + 1 $ shifts every point one unit to the right.\n",
       "- **Rotation:** $ \\omega = i z = r e^{i(\\theta + \\pi/2)} $ rotates every point by 90° counterclockwise.\n",
       "- **Reflection:** $ \\omega = \\overline{z} = x - iy $ reflects points about the real axis.\n",
