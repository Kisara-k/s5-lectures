## 4. Triple Integrals in Other Coordinate Systems

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on your lecture content about triple integrals in other coordinate systems and transformations. The explanations are clear and thorough, with key concepts carefully unpacked. Emojis and numbering are used for clarity and structure.



### 1. üåê Introduction to Triple Integrals in Other Coordinate Systems

When working with triple integrals, sometimes the standard rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates \((x, y, z)\) are not the easiest or most natural way to describe the region of integration. For example, when dealing with spheres or cones, spherical or cylindrical coordinates often simplify the problem significantly. This section introduces how triple integrals can be expressed and evaluated in spherical coordinates, and how transformations using Jacobians help us change variables in multiple integrals.



### 2. üîµ Spherical Coordinate System: Definition and Conversion

The spherical coordinate system is a way to represent points in three-dimensional space using three parameters: \(\rho\), \(\phi\), and \(\theta\).

- \(\rho\) (rho) is the distance from the origin to the point.
- \(\phi\) (phi) is the angle measured from the positive \(z\)-axis down toward the \(xy\)-plane (polar angle).
- \(\theta\) (theta) is the angle measured in the \(xy\)-plane from the positive \(x\)-axis (azimuthal angle).

The conversion formulas from spherical coordinates \((\rho, \phi, \theta)\) to rectangular coordinates \((x, y, z)\) are:

\[
x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta
\]
\[
y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta
\]
\[
z = \rho \cos \phi
\]

This system is especially useful for regions that are naturally spherical or radially symmetric.



### 3. üì¶ Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates: Definition and Evaluation

#### 3.1 Understanding the Triple Integral in Spherical Coordinates

A triple integral in spherical coordinates is a way to sum up values of a function \(f(\rho, \theta, \phi)\) over a three-dimensional region \(G\) described in spherical coordinates.

The integral is defined as the limit of sums over small spherical wedges (tiny volume elements shaped like slices of an orange). Each wedge has a volume \(\Delta V_k\), and the function is evaluated at some point inside that wedge \((\rho_k^*, \theta_k^*, \phi_k^*)\).

Mathematically:

\[
\iiint_G f(\rho, \theta, \phi) \, dV_{\rho \theta \phi} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n f(\rho_k^*, \theta_k^*, \phi_k^*) \Delta V_k
\]

#### 3.2 Volume Element in Spherical Coordinates

The volume of each small spherical wedge \(\Delta V_k\) is given by:

\[
\Delta V_k = \rho_k^{*2} \sin \phi_k^* \, \Delta \rho_k \, \Delta \phi_k \, \Delta \theta_k
\]

This formula comes from the geometry of spherical coordinates: the factor \(\rho^2 \sin \phi\) accounts for how volume elements stretch as you move away from the origin and around the sphere.

#### 3.3 Evaluating the Triple Integral as an Iterated Integral

Using the volume element, the triple integral can be written as an iterated integral:

\[
\iiint_G f(\rho, \theta, \phi) \, dV = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \int_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2} \int_{\rho_1}^{\rho_2} f(\rho, \theta, \phi) \, \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
\]

The limits \(\rho_1, \rho_2\), \(\phi_1, \phi_2\), and \(\theta_1, \theta_2\) depend on the region \(G\).

#### 3.4 Changing from Rectangular to Spherical Coordinates in Integrals

If you have a triple integral in rectangular coordinates:

\[
\iiint_G f(x, y, z) \, dV_{xyz}
\]

you can rewrite it in spherical coordinates by substituting \(x, y, z\) with their spherical equivalents and including the volume element factor:

\[
\iiint_G f(\rho \sin \phi \cos \theta, \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta, \rho \cos \phi) \, \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
\]



### 4. üßÆ Examples of Using Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates

#### Example 1: Volume of a Sphere

Using spherical coordinates, you can prove the formula for the volume of a sphere of radius \(R\):

\[
V = \iiint_{\text{sphere}} dV = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \int_0^R \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
\]

Evaluating this integral step-by-step yields the well-known volume formula:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3
\]

#### Example 2: Converting a Complex Integral

Given an integral like:

\[
I = \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \int_{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}}^{\sqrt{2-x^2-y^2}} (x^2 + y^2) \, dz \, dy \, dx
\]

Converting to spherical coordinates simplifies the limits and the integrand, making the integral easier to evaluate.



### 5. üîÑ Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals: The Role of Jacobians

When changing variables in integrals, especially in multiple integrals, we need to account for how the area or volume elements change under the transformation. This is where the Jacobian comes in.

#### 5.1 Change of Variables in Single Integrals (Review)

For a single integral, if you substitute \(x = g(u)\), then:

\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \int_{g^{-1}(a)}^{g^{-1}(b)} f(g(u)) g'(u) \, du
\]

Here, \(g'(u)\) adjusts for how the length element \(dx\) changes when expressed in terms of \(du\).

#### 5.2 Transformations in the Plane

A transformation \(T\) maps points \((u, v)\) in the \(uv\)-plane to points \((x, y)\) in the \(xy\)-plane via:

\[
x = x(u, v), \quad y = y(u, v)
\]

- The image of a set \(S\) in the \(uv\)-plane under \(T\) is a set \(R\) in the \(xy\)-plane.
- If \(T\) is one-to-one (distinct points map to distinct points), it has an inverse \(T^{-1}\).

Visualizing \(T\) involves looking at how vertical and horizontal lines in the \(uv\)-plane map to curves in the \(xy\)-plane, called constant \(u\)-curves and constant \(v\)-curves.

#### 5.3 Jacobians in Two Variables

The Jacobian determinant measures how area elements change under the transformation \(T\):

\[
J(u, v) = \frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(u, v)} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}
\end{vmatrix}
= \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} - \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}
\]

This determinant tells us how a small area \(dA_{uv}\) in the \(uv\)-plane scales to an area \(dA_{xy}\) in the \(xy\)-plane.

#### 5.4 Change of Variable Formula for Double Integrals

If \(T\) maps region \(S\) in the \(uv\)-plane to region \(R\) in the \(xy\)-plane, and the Jacobian \(J(u,v)\) is non-zero and does not change sign on \(S\), then:

\[
\iint_R f(x, y) \, dA_{xy} = \iint_S f(x(u, v), y(u, v)) \, |J(u, v)| \, dA_{uv}
\]

This formula allows us to evaluate integrals over complicated regions by transforming them into simpler regions.

#### 5.5 Jacobians in Three Variables

For transformations from \((u, v, w)\) to \((x, y, z)\):

\[
x = x(u, v, w), \quad y = y(u, v, w), \quad z = z(u, v, w)
\]

The Jacobian is the determinant of the 3x3 matrix of partial derivatives:

\[
J(u, v, w) = \frac{\partial(x, y, z)}{\partial(u, v, w)} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial w} \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial w} \\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial w}
\end{vmatrix}
\]

#### 5.6 Change of Variable Formula for Triple Integrals

If the transformation \(T\) maps region \(S\) in \((u, v, w)\)-space to region \(R\) in \((x, y, z)\)-space, and the Jacobian is non-zero and does not change sign, then:

\[
\iiint_R f(x, y, z) \, dV_{xyz} = \iiint_S f(x(u, v, w), y(u, v, w), z(u, v, w)) \, |J(u, v, w)| \, dV_{uvw}
\]

This formula is essential for evaluating triple integrals after a change of variables, such as switching to spherical or cylindrical coordinates.
