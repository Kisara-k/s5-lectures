       "### 1. 🧮 Analytic Functions: What They Are and Examples\n",
       "\n",
       "When we talk about **analytic functions** in complex analysis, we mean functions that are \"nice\" enough to have a complex derivative at every point in some region. This is stronger than just having a derivative at a single point; the function must be differentiable in a whole neighborhood around that point.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### What Does It Mean for a Function to be Analytic?\n",
       "\n",
       "A function $ f(z) $ is **analytic** at a point $ z_0 $ if it has a complex derivative at every point in some open neighborhood around $ z_0 $. If a function is analytic everywhere in the complex plane (except possibly at infinity), it is called **entire**.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Examples of Analytic and Non-Analytic Functions\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Example 1:** $ f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} $ is analytic everywhere except at $ z = 0 $ because the function is well-defined and differentiable at all other points.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Example 2:** $ f(z) = |z|^2 $ is **not analytic anywhere** except possibly at $ z=0 $, but even there, it does not have a derivative in any neighborhood. This is because the absolute value function depends on both $ z $ and its conjugate $ \\bar{z} $, breaking the complex differentiability condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Example 3:** Every polynomial function (like $ f(z) = z^2 + 3z + 1 $) is **entire** because polynomials are differentiable everywhere in the complex plane.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Singular Points (Singularities)\n",
       "\n",
       "A **singular point** is a point where a function fails to be analytic, but it is analytic in every neighborhood around that point (except possibly at the point itself).\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Isolated singularity:** There exists a small radius $ \\delta $ such that the function is analytic everywhere in the punctured disk $ 0 < |z - a| < \\delta $, but not analytic at $ z = a $ itself. For example, $ z=0 $ is an isolated singularity of $ f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} $.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Non-isolated singularities:** These are singular points that are not isolated. For example, branch cuts like those for $ \\log(z) $ or $ \\sqrt{z} $ along the negative real axis are non-isolated singularities.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Important Properties of Analytic Functions\n",
       "\n",
       "- The sum, product, and quotient (where denominator is non-zero) of analytic functions are analytic.\n",
       "- The composition of analytic functions is analytic.\n",
       "- If the derivative of a function is zero everywhere in a domain, the function must be constant in that domain.\n",
