## 12. Residue Theory

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized, and clear study note based on the lecture content on **Residue Theory**. The explanations are thorough and accessible, avoiding overly academic jargon, and include emojis for clarity in the main headings.



### 1. 🧩 Introduction to Residue Theory and Singularities

Residue theory is a powerful tool in complex analysis that helps us evaluate complex integrals, especially those involving functions with singularities. To understand residue theory, we first need to understand what singularities are and how they are classified.

#### What is a Singular Point?

A **singular point** (or singularity) of a complex function \( f(z) \) is a point \( \alpha \) where the function is **not analytic** (not differentiable in the complex sense), but in every neighborhood around \( \alpha \), there are points where \( f \) *is* analytic. This means the function misbehaves only at \( \alpha \), but behaves nicely nearby.

#### Isolated Singularities

An **isolated singularity** is a singular point \( \alpha \) such that there exists some radius \( R > 0 \) where \( f \) is analytic everywhere in the punctured disk around \( \alpha \), denoted by

\[
D_R^*(\alpha) = \{ z : 0 < |z - \alpha| < R \}
\]

This means \( f \) is analytic everywhere near \( \alpha \) except exactly at \( \alpha \).

**Example:** The function \( f(z) = \frac{1}{1-z} \) is not analytic at \( z=1 \) (division by zero), but analytic everywhere else. So, \( z=1 \) is an isolated singularity.



### 2. 🔍 Classification of Isolated Singularities

Isolated singularities can be classified by looking at the **Laurent series** expansion of \( f \) around \( \alpha \):

\[
f(z) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k (z - \alpha)^k
\]

valid for \( 0 < |z - \alpha| < R \).

#### Types of Singularities

- **Removable Singularity:** All coefficients \( a_k = 0 \) for \( k < 0 \). This means the function behaves like a normal analytic function except possibly at \( \alpha \), and the singularity can be "removed" by defining \( f(\alpha) \) appropriately.

- **Pole of order \( n \):** There exists a finite negative power \( -n \) such that \( a_{-n} \neq 0 \), but all \( a_k = 0 \) for \( k < -n \). The function "blows up" like \( \frac{1}{(z-\alpha)^n} \) near \( \alpha \).

- **Essential Singularity:** There are infinitely many negative powers with nonzero coefficients \( a_k \neq 0 \) for infinitely many \( k < 0 \). The function behaves very wildly near \( \alpha \).

#### Residue

The **residue** of \( f \) at \( \alpha \), denoted \( \text{Res}[f, \alpha] \), is the coefficient \( a_{-1} \) in the Laurent series. This coefficient plays a crucial role in evaluating integrals around singularities.



### 3. 🧮 Examples of Singularities

- \( f(z) = \frac{\sin z}{z} \) has a **removable singularity** at \( z=0 \) because the singularity can be removed by defining \( f(0) = 1 \).

- \( g(z) = \cos z - 1 \) also has a removable singularity at \( z=0 \).

- \( f(z) = \frac{\sin z}{z^3} \) has a **pole of order 2** at \( z=0 \) because the denominator has \( z^3 \) but the numerator behaves like \( z \) near zero, so the net effect is a \( \frac{1}{z^2} \) type singularity.

- \( g(z) = z e^z \) has a **simple pole** (pole of order 1) at \( z=0 \).

- \( f(z) = z^2 \sin z \) has an **essential singularity** at \( z=0 \) because the sine function's expansion has infinitely many negative powers when combined with \( z^2 \).



### 4. 🔢 Zeros of Analytic Functions

A **zero** of order \( k \) at \( z = \alpha \) means the function \( f \) and its first \( k-1 \) derivatives vanish at \( \alpha \), but the \( k \)-th derivative does not:

\[
f^{(n)}(\alpha) = 0 \quad \text{for } n=0,1,\ldots,k-1, \quad \text{and} \quad f^{(k)}(\alpha) \neq 0
\]

- A zero of order 1 is called a **simple zero**.

#### Taylor Series and Zeros

If \( f \) is analytic at \( \alpha \), its Taylor series is

\[
f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (z - \alpha)^n
\]

Then \( f \) has a zero of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \) if and only if

\[
c_0 = c_1 = \cdots = c_{k-1} = 0, \quad \text{and} \quad c_k \neq 0
\]

#### Factorization Form

A function with a zero of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \) can be written as

\[
f(z) = (z - \alpha)^k g(z)
\]

where \( g \) is analytic at \( \alpha \) and \( g(\alpha) \neq 0 \).



### 5. ⚖️ Relationship Between Zeros and Poles

- If \( f \) has a zero of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \), then \( g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z)} \) has a **pole of order \( k \)** at \( \alpha \).

- Conversely, if \( f \) has a pole of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \), then \( g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z)} \) has a **removable singularity** at \( \alpha \), and redefining \( g(\alpha) = 0 \) makes \( g \) have a zero of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \).

#### Combining Zeros and Poles

- The product of two functions with zeros of orders \( m \) and \( n \) at \( \alpha \) has a zero of order \( m + n \).

- The product of two functions with poles of orders \( m \) and \( n \) at \( \alpha \) has a pole of order \( m + n \).

- For the quotient \( h(z) = \frac{f(z)}{g(z)} \), where \( f \) and \( g \) have zeros of orders \( m \) and \( n \) at \( \alpha \):

  1. If \( m > n \), \( h \) has a removable singularity at \( \alpha \), and redefining \( h(\alpha) = 0 \) gives a zero of order \( m - n \).
  
  2. If \( m < n \), \( h \) has a pole of order \( n - m \).
  
  3. If \( m = n \), \( h \) has a removable singularity and can be defined to be analytic at \( \alpha \).



### 6. 🧮 Residues and Their Calculation

The **residue** at a singularity \( \alpha \) is the coefficient \( a_{-1} \) in the Laurent series expansion of \( f \) around \( \alpha \).

#### Cauchy's Residue Theorem

This theorem is fundamental in complex analysis and states:

If \( f \) is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour \( C \), except for isolated singularities \( z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n \) inside \( C \), then

\[
\oint_C f(z) \, dz = 2 \pi i \sum_{k=1}^n \text{Res}[f, z_k]
\]

This means the integral of \( f \) around \( C \) depends only on the sum of residues at the singularities inside \( C \).

#### Residue at Removable Singularities

If \( \alpha \) is a removable singularity, then all negative powers in the Laurent series vanish, so

\[
\text{Res}[f, \alpha] = 0
\]

#### Residue at Poles of Order \( n \)

If \( \alpha \) is a pole of order \( n \), the residue can be computed by

\[
\text{Res}[f, \alpha] = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \lim_{z \to \alpha} \frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}} \left[ (z - \alpha)^n f(z) \right]
\]

This formula allows us to find residues without explicitly finding the Laurent series.



### 7. 🧩 Examples of Residue Calculations and Applications

- For \( f(z) = e^z \), the residue at \( z=0 \) is 0 because \( e^z \) is entire (analytic everywhere) and has no singularities.

- For \( g(z) = 2z + z^2 - z^3 \), the residue at \( z=0 \) is 0 since it is a polynomial (analytic everywhere).

- For \( f(z) = \pi \cot(\pi z) \), the residue at \( z=0 \) is 1 (a classic example related to the cotangent function's simple poles).

#### Using Residues to Evaluate Integrals

Residue theory is especially useful for evaluating complex integrals over closed contours, such as

\[
\oint_C \frac{z^4 + z^3 - 2z^2}{\ldots} dz
\]

where the contour \( C \) is a circle around singularities. By summing the residues inside \( C \), we can find the integral value using Cauchy's Residue Theorem.



## Summary

Residue theory revolves around understanding singularities of complex functions, classifying them, and using the residues (coefficients of \( (z-\alpha)^{-1} \) terms) to evaluate complex integrals. The key concepts include:

- **Isolated singularities** and their classification into removable, poles, and essential singularities.
- **Zeros** of analytic functions and their orders.
- The relationship between zeros and poles.
- The **residue** as a crucial coefficient in the Laurent series.
- **Cauchy's Residue Theorem** for evaluating integrals.
- Practical methods to calculate residues, especially at poles.

Mastering these ideas provides a powerful toolkit for solving many problems in complex analysis and applied mathematics.

Certainly! Below are the correct answers for each question along with brief explanations.



#### 1. Which of the following statements correctly define an isolated singularity of a complex function \( f \) at a point \( \alpha \)?

**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:** An isolated singularity means \( f \) is not analytic at \( \alpha \), but analytic in some punctured neighborhood around \( \alpha \) (A). Also, \( f \) is analytic everywhere except at \( \alpha \) (C). B and D are incorrect because B says \( f \) is analytic at \( \alpha \) (contradiction), and D says no neighborhood contains analytic points (not isolated).



#### 2. Which condition characterizes a **removable singularity** at \( \alpha \)?

**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:** A removable singularity means no negative powers in the Laurent series, so \( a_k = 0 \) for all \( k < 0 \). B, C, and D describe poles or essential singularities.



#### 3. A function \( f \) has a pole of order 3 at \( z = \alpha \). Which of the following must be true?

**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:** For a pole of order 3, \( a_{-3} \neq 0 \) and all \( a_k = 0 \) for \( k < -3 \). The residue \( a_{-1} \) may or may not be zero, so D is not necessarily true.



#### 4. Which of the following functions has an essential singularity at \( z=0 \)?

**Correct:** A, D  
**Explanation:** \( e^{1/z} \) and \( z^2 \sin(1/z) \) have infinitely many negative powers in their Laurent expansions, characteristic of essential singularities. B is a pole, C is entire (analytic everywhere).



#### 5. The residue of a function \( f \) at a removable singularity \( \alpha \) is always:

#### 10. Which of the following functions has a simple pole at \( z=0 \)?

**Correct:** A, D  
**Explanation:** \( \frac{1}{z} \) and \( \frac{e^z}{z} \) have simple poles at zero. \( \frac{1}{z^2} \) has a pole of order 2, and \( \frac{\sin z}{z} \) has a removable singularity at zero.



#### 11. The residue of \( f(z) = \frac{1}{(z-\alpha)^n} \) at \( z = \alpha \) is:

**Correct:** A, B

#### 14. Which of the following functions has a removable singularity at \( z=0 \)?

**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:** Both \( \frac{\sin z}{z} \) and \( \frac{e^z - 1}{z} \) can be defined at zero to remove the singularity. B and D have poles.



#### 15. If \( f(z) = z \sin z^2 \), what type of singularity does \( f \) have at \( z=0 \)?

**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:** \( f \) is analytic at zero (no negative powers), so the singularity is removable (or no singularity at all).



#### 16. Which of the following is true about the zeros of analytic functions?

**Correct:** A, C, D  
**Explanation:** These are correct definitions and properties of zeros. B is false (zeros are not poles).



#### 17. Suppose \( f(z) = \frac{\tan z}{z} \). Which of the following statements about zeros and poles of \( f \) is correct?

**Correct:** A, D  
**Explanation:** \( \tan z \) has zeros at \( n \pi \), but \( f \) has a pole at zero due to division by \( z \). Poles of \( \tan z \) are at \( (n + \frac{1}{2}) \pi \).



#### 18. If \( f \) has a pole of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \), what can be said about \( g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z)} \)?

**Correct:** A, C

#### 19. Which of the following integrals can be evaluated using the residue theorem?

**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:** Closed contour integrals around singularities can be evaluated by residues. B is a real integral (not directly residue theorem), D is improper integral on real line.



#### 20. Which of the following statements about the product of two functions \( f \) and \( g \) analytic at \( \alpha \) is true?

**Correct:** B, C  
**Explanation:** The order of poles or zeros of the product is the sum of the orders. A is false because zeros and poles do not subtract in that way. D is false because the product can have singularities if either function has one.
