Let 𝒫[𝑎, 𝑏] be the set of all such partitions. Define 𝑠(𝒓, 𝑃) = ∑ and length of the curve as 𝑠(𝒓) = sup{s(𝒓, 𝑃)| 𝑃∈𝒫[𝑎, 𝑏]}. Definition 2.1.2: 𝒓 is rectifiable iff 𝑠(𝒓) ∈ℝ .

Definition 2.1.3: A change of parameter in a vector-valued function 𝒓(𝑡) is a substitution 𝑡= 𝑔(𝜏) that produces a new vector-valued function 𝒓(𝑔(𝜏)) having the same graph as 𝒓(𝑡), but possibly traced differently as parameter 𝜏 increases.

If 𝑡= 𝑔(𝜏) is a change of parameter in which 𝑔 is differentiable with respect to 𝜏, then 𝒓(𝑔(𝜏)) is differentiable with respect to 𝜏 and Definition 2.1.4: Let 𝐶 be the graph of a 𝐶1 vector-valued function 𝒓(𝑡) with non-zero derivative and let 𝒓(𝑡0) be any point on 𝐶. Then the following defines a position change of parameter from 𝑡 to 𝑠, which we call an arc length parameter having reference point 𝒓(𝑡0): Example: Express the helix 𝒓(𝑡) = (sin 𝑡, cos 𝑡, 2𝑡) in terms of arc length measured from the point 𝑃0(0,1,0) in the direction of increasing 𝑡. Theorem 2.1.3: Let 𝐶 be the graph of a 𝐶1 vector-valued function 𝒓 such that 𝒓'(𝑡) ≠0; ∀𝑡. Suppose 𝑡 is a general parameter and 𝑠 is an arc length parameter for 𝐶, then a) ∀𝑡, the tangent vector has length b) ∀𝑠, the tangent vector has length 𝑑𝑡|| = 1; ∀𝑡, then for every value of 𝑡0, the parameter 𝜎= 𝑡-𝑡0 is the arc length parameter with reference point at the point on 𝐶 corresponding to 𝑡= 𝑡0.

Definition 2.2.3: Let 𝐶 be the graph of a 𝐶1 vector-valued function 𝒓 in 3-space such that 𝒓'(𝑡) ≠0; ∀𝑡. Then the binormal vector 𝑩(𝑡) can be defined at each 𝑡 as follows, It follows from properties of the cross product that 𝑩(𝑡) is orthogonal to both 𝑻(𝑡) and 𝑵(t) and is oriented relative to 𝑻(𝑡) and 𝑵(t) by the right-hand rule. Moreover, 𝑻(𝑡) × 𝑵(t) is a unit vector since ||𝑻(𝑡) × 𝑵(t)|| = ||𝑻(𝑡)|| ||𝑵(𝑡)||sin Thus, {𝑻(𝑡), 𝑵(𝑡), 𝑩(𝑡)} is a set of three mutually orthogonal unit vectors ; for every 𝑡.

At each point on the parametric curve 𝐶 in 3-space, these vectors determine three mutually perpendicular planes that passes through the point, namely, the TB-plane (called the rectifying plane), the TN-plane (called the osculating plane), and the NB - plane (called normal plane). The coordinate system determined by 𝑻(𝑡), 𝑵(𝑡), 𝑩(𝑡)is called the TNB-frame. Alternatively, the binormal 𝑩(𝑡) can be expressed directly in terms of 𝒓(𝑡) as And when the parameter is an arc length parameter it can be expressed as 2.3 Curvature Definition 2.3.1: Let 𝐶 be the graph of a 𝐶1 vector-valued function 𝒓 with non-zero derivative.

Definition 2.3.2: Radius of Curvature If a curve 𝐶 in 2 - space has non-zero curvature 𝜅 at a point 𝑃, then the circle of radius 𝜌= 1/𝜅 sharing a common tangent with 𝐶 at 𝑃, and centered on the concave side of the curve at 𝑃, is called the osculating circle or circle of curvature at 𝑃. The radius 𝜌 of osculating circle at 𝑃 is called the radius of curvature at 𝑃 and the center of the circle is called center of curvature at 𝑃."

So, we will have So, the line integral can be expressed in terms of 𝑡 in the following fashion, Remark: If 𝐶 is a curve in the 𝑥𝑦 - plane and 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦) is a non-negative continuous function defined on 𝐶, then ∫𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦)𝑑𝑠 can be interpreted as the area 𝐴 of the \"sheet\" that is swept out by a vertical line segment that extends upward from the point (𝑥, 𝑦) to a height of 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦) and moves along 𝐶 from one endpoint to the other.

There exist mathematical surfaces with only one side. This surface is called a M¨obius strip. Calculus - MA2024 - 2022/2021 Batch - S3/S5 - University of Moratuwa Dr. Supem Samarasiri, Department of Mathematics, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka Last updated: 08/29/2023 01:46AM Figure 6.5: M¨obius Strip In applications, it is important to have some way of distinguishing between the two sides of an orientable surface. For this purpose let us suppose that σ is an orientable surface that has a unit normal vector n at each point. It can be proved that if σ is a smooth orientable surface, then it is always possible to choose the direction of n at each point so that 𝐧 = 𝐧(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) varies continuously over the surface. These unit vectors are then said to form an orientation of the surface. Orientable Surface Definition 6.3.2: Orientation of a Smooth Parametric Surface When a surface is expressed parametrically, the parametric equations create a natural ori- entation of the surface. If a smooth parametric surface σ is given by the vector equation 𝐫 = 𝑥(𝑢, 𝑣)𝐢 + 𝑦(𝑢, 𝑣)𝐣 + 𝑧(𝑢, 𝑣)𝐤 then the unit normal is a continuous vector-valued function of u and v. Thus, n defines an orientation of the surface; we call this positive orientation of the parametric surface and we say that n points in the positive direction from the surface. The orientation determined by -𝐧 is called the negative orientation of the surface and we say that -𝐧 points in the negative direction from the surface.

Here, we assume that fluid is in a steady state and is incompressible. The volume of the fluid that flows through a portion of the surface depends on three factors: 1. The speed of the fluid: the greater the speed, the greater the volume. 2. How the surface is oriented relative to the flow: the more nearly orthogonal the flow is to the surface, the greater the volume. 3. The area of the portion of the surface: the greater the area, the greater the volume. Figure 6.7: Flux Let 𝐅 be a vector field whose components have continuous partial derivatives on the surface 𝜎 which is oriented by the unit normal field 𝐧, then the flux of 𝐅 across 𝜎 is given by the surface integral A positive flux means that in one unit of time a greater volume of fluid passes through σ in the positive direction than in the negative direction, a negative flux means that a greater volume passes through the surface in the negative direction than in the positive direction and a zero flux means that the same volume passes through the surface in each direction. Theorem 6.3.1: Let σ be a smooth parametric surface represented by the vector equation r = r(𝑢, 𝑣) in which (𝑢, 𝑣) varies over a region 𝑅 in the 𝑢𝑣 - plane.

Definition 6.3.4: Orientation of Non-Parametric Surfaces Non-parametric surfaces of the form z = g(x, y), y = g(z, x) and x = g(y, z) can be expressed parametrically using the independent variables as parameters. More precisely, these surfaces can be represented by the vector equations Table Here 𝒏= ||∇𝐺 || ; where 𝐺= 𝑧-𝑔(𝑥, 𝑦) or 𝐺= 𝑦-𝑔(𝑧, 𝑥) or 𝐺= 𝑥-𝑔(𝑦, 𝑧). Because, each of these equations has the form 𝐺(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) = 0 and hence can be viewed as a level surface of a function 𝐺(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧). The gradient of 𝐺 is normal to the level surfaces. Theorem 6.3.2: Let σ be a smooth surface of the form 𝑧 = 𝑔(𝑥, 𝑦) , 𝑦 = 𝑔(𝑧, 𝑥), or 𝑥 = 𝑔(𝑦, 𝑧), and suppose that the component functions of the vector field 𝐹 are continuous on 𝜎. Suppose also that the equation for 𝜎 is rewritten as 𝐺(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) = 0 by taking 𝑔 to the left side of the equation and let 𝑅 be the projection of 𝜎 on the coordinate plane determined by the independent variables of 𝑔.

Denote the volume of the region by vol(G) and the flux of F across σ(G) by 𝜙(G). If divF is continuous on G, then across the small region G the value of divF will not vary much from its value divF (P0) at the center, and we can reasonably approximate divF by the constant divF (P0) on G. ∭div𝐅 𝑑𝑉 ≈div𝐅(𝑃0) ∭𝑑𝑉 = div𝐅(𝑃0)𝑣𝑜𝑙(𝐺) .

    "content": "8 Limits and Differentiation of Functions of a Complex Variable. 8.1 Functions of a Complex Variable Definition 8.1.1: Let 𝑆 be a set of complex numbers. A function 𝑓 defined on 𝑆 is a rule that assigns to each 𝑧 in 𝑆 a complex number 𝜔. The number 𝜔 is called the value of 𝑓 at 𝑧 and is denoted by 𝑓(𝑧), that is, 𝜔 = 𝑓(𝑧). The set 𝑆 is called the domain of 𝑓. Suppose that ω = u + iv is the value of a function f at z = x + iy, so that u + iv = f (x + iy). Each of the real numbers u and v depends on the real variables x and y, and it follows that f (z) can be expressed in terms of a pair of real-valued functions of the real variables x and y: If the polar coordinates r and θ, instead of x and y, are used, then u + iv = f (reiθ), where ω = u + iv and z = reiθ. In that case, we may write f (z) = u(r, θ) + iv(r, θ) Examples 1. Write the function f (z) = z3 + z + 1 in the form f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y). 2. Suppose that f (z) = x2 - y2 - 2y + i(2x - 2xy), where z = x + iy. Use the identity 𝑥= and 𝑦= 2𝑖 to write 𝑓(𝑧) in terms of 𝑧, and simplify the result. 3. Write the function f (z) = 𝑧+ 𝑧 (𝑧≠0) in the form f (z) = u(r, θ) + iv(r, θ). Definition 8.1.1: Mapping A function f is often referred as a mapping or transformation. The image of a point z in the domain of definition S is the point ω = f (z), and the set of images of all points in a set T that is contained in S is called the image of T . The image of the entire domain of definition S is called the range of 𝑓. The inverse image of a point ω is the set of all points z in the domain of definition of 𝑓 that have ω as their image. Terms such as translation, rotation, and reflection are used to convey dominant geometric characteristics of certain mappings. In such cases, it is convenient to consider the z and ω planes to be the same. For example, the mapping ω = z + 1 = (x + 1) + iy, where z = x + iy and x, y ∈ R, can be thought of as a translation of each point z one unit to the right. Since 𝑖= 𝑒 2 , the mapping 𝜔= 𝑖𝑧= 𝑟 exp[𝑖(𝜃+ 2)] , where 𝑧= 𝑟𝑒𝑖𝜃, rotates the radial vector for each non-zero point z through a right angle about the origin in the counter-clockwise direction; and the mapping ω = 𝑧 = x - iy transforms each point z = x+iy into its reflection in the real axis.

The statement that the limit of f (z) as z approaches z0 is the complex number ω0, or that limz→z0 f (z) = ω0, means that the point ω = f (z) can be made arbitrarily close to ω0 if we choose the point z close enough to z0 but distinct from it.

The function 𝑓(𝑧) = 1/𝑧 is analytic at each non-zero finite point on the complex plane. 2. The function 𝑓(𝑧) = |𝑧|2 is not analytic at any point since its derivative exists only at 𝑧= 0 and not throughout any neighborhood. Definition 9.1.1: An entire function is a function that is analytic at each finite point in the complex plane. Example 3: Since the derivative of a polynomial exists everywhere, it follows that every polynomial is an entire function. Definition 9.1.2: Singular Points If a function 𝑓 fails to be analytic at a point 𝑎 but is analytic at some point in every neighborhood of 𝑎, then 𝑎 is called a singular point, or singularity, of 𝑓. Main Types of Singularities: 1.

Non-Isolated Singular Points: Singular points which are not isolated. 2.1 Branch Cuts: Ex. 𝐴𝑟𝑔(𝑧), 𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑧), √𝑧 along non-positive real axis. 2.2 Other: Ex. tan ( Examples: 4. The point z = 0 is the singular point of the function f (z) = 1/z. 5. The function f (z) = |z|2 has no singular points since it is nowhere analytic and has no branch cuts or other issues.

Thus, if two functions are analytic in a domain D, their sum and their product are both analytic in D. Similarly, their quotient is analytic in D provided the function in the denominator does not vanish at any point in D. In particular, the quotient P (z)/Q(z) of two polynomials is analytic in any domain throughout which Q(z) ≠ 0. Moreover, a composition of two analytic functions is analytic. More precisely, suppose that a function f (z) is analytic in a domain D and that the image of D under the transformation ω = f (z) is contained in the domain of definition of a function g(ω). Then the composition 𝑔[𝑓(𝑧)] is analytic in 𝐷, with derivative Theorem 9.1.1: If 𝑓'(𝑧) = 0 everywhere in a domain 𝐷, then 𝑓 (𝑧) must be constant throughout 𝐷. Proof: Is omitted. Examples: 6. If f (z) = cosh x cos y + i sinh x sin y, then f is entire. 7. If a function and its conjugate are analytic in a given domain, then the function is constant throughout the domain. 8. IF 𝑓 is an analytic function such that |f (z)| is constant throughout the domain 𝐷, then f (z) is constant throughout 𝐷. 9.2 C-R Equations and Harmonic Functions Definition 9.2.1: A real-valued function H of two real variables x and y is said to be harmonic in a given domain of the xy - plane if, throughout that domain, it has continuous partial derivatives of the first and second order and satisfies the partial differential equation Hxx(x, y) + Hyy(x, y) = 0, known as Laplace's equation. Example 9: Verify that the function T (x, y) = e-y sin x is harmonic in any domain of the xy - plane and in the semi-infinite vertical strip 0 < x < π, y > 0. Theorem 9.2.1: If a function f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is analytic in a domain 𝐷, then its component functions u and v are harmonic in 𝐷. Example 10: Show that components of the function f (z) = e-y sin x-ie-y cos x are harmonic. Definition 9.2.2: Given two real valued functions 𝑢, 𝑣 defined on a region 𝐷⊂ℝ2, we say that 𝑣 is a harmonic conjugate to 𝑢 iff is analytic on 𝐷.

The point α is called an isolated singularity of a complex function 𝑓 if 𝑓 is not analytic at α, but there exists a real number 𝑅 > 0 such that 𝑓 is analytic everywhere in the punctured disk 𝐷𝑅 Example 1: the function 𝑓(𝑧) = 1-𝑧 is not analytic at 𝑧= 1, but is analytic for all other values of 𝑧. Thus, the point 𝑧= 1 is a singular point of 𝑓. It is also an isolated singularity of 𝑓. Definition 12.1.2: (Further Classification of Isolated Singularities) If 𝛼 is an isolated singularity of 𝑓 we can find the Laurent Series expansion valid for 0 < |𝑧-𝛼| < 𝑅. We say 𝛼 is a a) Removable Singularity of 𝑓: 𝑎𝑘= 0 ; ∀ 𝑘< 0 , b) Pole of order 𝑛 of 𝑓: 𝑎-𝑛≠0 and 𝑎𝑘= 0 ; ∀𝑘< -𝑛 , c) Essential Singularity of 𝑓: 𝑎𝑘≠0 ; for an infinite number of 𝑘< 0 .
