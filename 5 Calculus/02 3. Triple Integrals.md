## 3. Triple Integrals

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on your lecture content on **Triple Integrals**. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the concepts step-by-step without skipping any important details. Iâ€™ve also added emojis to main headings for clarity and engagement.



## 1. ðŸ“¦ What Are Triple Integrals?

Triple integrals extend the idea of single and double integrals into three dimensions. Instead of integrating over a line or a surface, triple integrals allow us to integrate over a **solid region** in three-dimensional space.

Imagine you have a solid object \( G \) in 3D space, and a function \( f(x,y,z) \) defined on this solid. The triple integral of \( f \) over \( G \) essentially sums up the values of \( f \) at every point inside \( G \), weighted by tiny volumes. This is useful for calculating things like mass, volume, or total charge when the density or intensity varies throughout the solid.



## 2. ðŸ§± Defining Triple Integrals: The Riemann Sum Approach

To understand triple integrals rigorously, we start by breaking down the solid \( G \) into many small rectangular boxes (called **subboxes**). These subboxes are formed by slicing the solid with planes parallel to the coordinate planes (the \( xy \), \( yz \), and \( zx \) planes).

- We divide the solid into \( n \) subboxes.
- We ignore any subboxes that lie outside the solid \( G \).
- For each remaining subbox, pick a sample point \((x_k^*, y_k^*, z_k^*)\).
- Let the volume of the \( k \)-th subbox be \( \Delta V_k \).

The **Riemann sum** for the triple integral is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*, y_k^*, z_k^*) \Delta V_k
\]

As we make the subboxes smaller and smaller (letting \( n \to \infty \)), this sum approaches the **triple integral**:

\[
\iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*, y_k^*, z_k^*) \Delta V_k
\]

This limit, if it exists, gives the exact integral of \( f \) over the solid \( G \).



## 3. ðŸ”‘ Properties of Triple Integrals

Triple integrals share many properties similar to single and double integrals:

- **Linearity:** You can pull constants out and split sums inside the integral.
  
  a) Multiplying the function by a constant \( c \) scales the integral by \( c \):
  
  \[
  \iiint_G c f(x,y,z) \, dV = c \iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV
  \]
  
  b) The integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals:
  
  \[
  \iiint_G [f(x,y,z) + g(x,y,z)] \, dV = \iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV + \iiint_G g(x,y,z) \, dV
  \]
  
  c) Similarly for subtraction:
  
  \[
  \iiint_G [f(x,y,z) - g(x,y,z)] \, dV = \iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV - \iiint_G g(x,y,z) \, dV
  \]

- **Additivity over regions:** If the solid \( G \) is split into two parts \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \), then the integral over \( G \) is the sum of the integrals over \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \):

\[
\iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV = \iiint_{G_1} f(x,y,z) \, dV + \iiint_{G_2} f(x,y,z) \, dV
\]



## 4. ðŸ”„ Fubiniâ€™s Theorem for Triple Integrals

Fubiniâ€™s theorem is a powerful tool that allows us to compute triple integrals as **iterated integrals** â€” that is, integrating one variable at a time.

Suppose \( G \) is a rectangular box defined by:

\[
a \leq x \leq b, \quad c \leq y \leq d, \quad k \leq z \leq l
\]

and \( f \) is continuous on \( G \). Then:

\[
\iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV = \int_a^b \int_c^d \int_k^l f(x,y,z) \, dz \, dy \, dx
\]

The order of integration can be changed in any way (there are 6 possible orders for three variables), which gives flexibility depending on the problem.

**Example:** Evaluate

\[
\iiint_B z^2 y e^x \, dV
\]

where \( B \) is the box:

\[
0 \leq x \leq 1, \quad 1 \leq y \leq 2, \quad -1 \leq z \leq 1
\]

You would integrate \( z \), then \( y \), then \( x \) (or any order), using the limits given.



## 5. ðŸŒ„ Triple Integrals Over More General Regions

Not all solids are simple boxes. Often, the solid \( G \) is bounded by curved surfaces. To handle this, we use the idea of **projection** onto coordinate planes.

Suppose \( G \) is bounded above and below by surfaces:

\[
z = v(x,y) \quad \text{(upper surface)}, \quad z = u(x,y) \quad \text{(lower surface)}
\]

and the projection of \( G \) onto the \( xy \)-plane is a region \( R \). If \( u \) and \( v \) are continuous and \( u(x,y) \leq v(x,y) \) for all \( (x,y) \in R \), then \( G \) is called a **simple \( xy \)-solid**.

The triple integral over \( G \) can be written as:

\[
\iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV = \iint_R \left( \int_{u(x,y)}^{v(x,y)} f(x,y,z) \, dz \right) dA
\]

Here, you first integrate with respect to \( z \) between the surfaces, then integrate over the region \( R \) in the \( xy \)-plane.



### Types of Projections

- **Vertically simple region (Type I):** For each fixed \( x \) in \([a,b]\), \( y \) varies between two functions \( g_1(x) \) and \( g_2(x) \):

\[
a \leq x \leq b, \quad g_1(x) \leq y \leq g_2(x)
\]

The triple integral becomes:

\[
\iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV = \int_a^b \int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} \int_{u(x,y)}^{v(x,y)} f(x,y,z) \, dz \, dy \, dx
\]

- **Horizontally simple region (Type II):** For each fixed \( y \) in \([c,d]\), \( x \) varies between two functions \( h_1(y) \) and \( h_2(y) \):

\[
c \leq y \leq d, \quad h_1(y) \leq x \leq h_2(y)
\]

The triple integral becomes:

\[
\iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV = \int_c^d \int_{h_1(y)}^{h_2(y)} \int_{u(x,y)}^{v(x,y)} f(x,y,z) \, dz \, dx \, dy
\]



## 6. ðŸ§® Examples of Triple Integrals Over General Regions

1. **Evaluate** \(\iiint_D x \, dV\), where \( D \) is the solid in the first octant bounded by the cylinder \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \) and the plane \( 2y + z = 4 \).

2. **Find the volume** of the tetrahedron bounded by the plane \( 2x + y + 3z = 6 \) and the coordinate planes \( x=0, y=0, z=0 \).

3. **Find the volume** of the solid bounded below by the paraboloid \( z = x^2 + y^2 \) and above by the plane \( 2x + z = 3 \).

These problems involve setting up the limits carefully based on the surfaces and projections, then evaluating the iterated integrals.



## 7. ðŸ”„ Triple Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates

Sometimes, the solid \( G \) and the function \( f \) are easier to describe in **cylindrical coordinates** \((r, \theta, z)\), where:

\[
x = r \cos \theta, \quad y = r \sin \theta, \quad z = z
\]

Cylindrical coordinates are especially useful for solids with circular symmetry, like cylinders or cones.



### Definition and Setup

The triple integral in cylindrical coordinates is defined similarly via Riemann sums, but the volume element changes because of the coordinate transformation.

The volume element in cylindrical coordinates is:

\[
dV = r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

The extra factor \( r \) accounts for the "stretching" of the area element in polar coordinates.



### Theorem for Cylindrical Coordinates

If the solid \( G \) is bounded above and below by surfaces:

\[
z = v(r, \theta), \quad z = u(r, \theta)
\]

and the projection of \( G \) onto the \( xy \)-plane is a simple polar region \( R \), then:

\[
\iiint_G f(r, \theta, z) \, dV = \iint_R \left( \int_{u(r,\theta)}^{v(r,\theta)} f(r, \theta, z) \, dz \right) r \, dr \, d\theta
\]

If \( R \) is described by:

\[
\theta_1 \leq \theta \leq \theta_2, \quad r_1(\theta) \leq r \leq r_2(\theta)
\]

then the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \int_{r_1(\theta)}^{r_2(\theta)} \int_{u(r,\theta)}^{v(r,\theta)} f(r, \theta, z) \, r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]



### Converting Rectangular to Cylindrical Coordinates

A triple integral in rectangular coordinates can be rewritten as:

\[
\iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV = \int \int \int f(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta, z) \, r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

where the limits are adjusted to match the region \( G \) in cylindrical coordinates.



## 8. ðŸ§© Examples Using Cylindrical Coordinates

1. **Find the volume** of the solid in the first octant bounded by the cylinder:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 2y
\]

the half-cone:

\[
z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

and the \( xy \)-plane.

2. **Convert the integral**

\[
I = \int \int \int \frac{x^2 + y^2}{\sqrt{2 - x^2 - y^2}} \, dz \, dy \, dx
\]

with limits involving \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), into cylindrical coordinates for easier evaluation.

## Answers

Certainly! Below are the correct answers for each question along with brief explanations.



#### 1. Which of the following statements correctly describe the definition of a triple integral over a solid region \( G \)?

**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:** The triple integral is defined by dividing the solid into subboxes (A), and the integral is the limit of sums of function values times subbox volumes (B). It is not just over the surface (C), and it applies to any finite solid, not only rectangular boxes (D).



#### 2. Which properties hold true for triple integrals? (Select all that apply)

**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** Linearity properties (A, B, D) hold for triple integrals. The integral is over volume, not area (C is false).



#### 3. Fubiniâ€™s theorem for triple integrals states that if \( f \) is continuous on a rectangular box \( G \), then:

**Correct:** A, D  
**Explanation:** Fubiniâ€™s theorem allows integration in any order (A), and the triple integral equals the iterated integral over the box (D). (B) is false because order is not fixed, and (C) is incorrect.

**Explanation:** \( G \) is a simple \( xy \)-solid if \( u \leq v \) (A), the triple integral can be written as an iterated integral with \( z \) limits \( u \) to \( v \) (B), and the limits for \( z \) depend on \( x,y \) (D). The projection \( R \) need not be a rectangle (C is false).



#### 5. When the projection \( R \) of a solid \( G \) onto the \( xy \)-plane is vertically simple (Type I), the limits of integration for \( y \) are:

**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:** For Type I regions, \( y \) varies between functions of \( x \), \( g_1(x) \) and \( g_2(x) \). (A) is false because limits depend on \( x \), (C) is for Type II, and (D) is arbitrary.



#### 6. Which of the following correctly describes the volume element \( dV \) in cylindrical coordinates?

**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:** The volume element in cylindrical coordinates is \( dV = r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta \) due to the Jacobian factor \( r \).



#### 7. In cylindrical coordinates, the triple integral over a solid \( G \) bounded by \( z = u(r,\theta) \) and \( z = v(r,\theta) \) and projection \( R \) on the \( xy \)-plane is:

**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:** The integral includes the factor \( r \) in the volume element, so the integrand is multiplied by \( r \).



#### 8. Which of the following solids is best described using cylindrical coordinates?

**Correct:** B, D  
**Explanation:** Cylindrical coordinates are ideal for solids with circular symmetry like cylinders (B) and paraboloids (D). Cubes (A) and tetrahedrons bounded by planes (C) are better handled in rectangular coordinates.

#### 12. Which of the following is NOT a valid property of triple integrals?

**Correct:** C  
**Explanation:** Triple integrals can be negative if the function is negative, so (C) is false. The other properties are true.



#### 13. The volume of a tetrahedron bounded by the plane \( 2x + y + 3z = 6 \) and the coordinate planes can be found by:

**Correct:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** You can set up a triple integral (A), use the pyramid volume formula (B), or express the region as a simple \( xy \)-solid (C). Cylindrical coordinates (D) are not convenient here.



#### 14. Which of the following integrals represents the triple integral of \( f(x,y,z) \) over a rectangular box \( G \) with limits \( a \leq x \leq b \), \( c \leq y \leq d \), and \( k \leq z \leq l \)?

**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:** The standard order is \( dz \, dy \, dx \), but any order is possible. Among options, only (B) has the correct order and limits.



#### 15. In the triple integral \(\iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV\), if \( G \) is subdivided into two subregions \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \), which of the following is true?

**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:** The integral over \( G \) is the sum of integrals over \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) if they are disjoint.



#### 16. Which of the following is a correct expression for the volume element \( dV \) in rectangular coordinates?

**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:** In rectangular coordinates, \( dV = dx \, dy \, dz \).



#### 17. Which of the following solids can be described as a simple \( xy \)-solid?

**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:** A solid bounded above and below by surfaces \( z = u(x,y) \) and \( z = v(x,y) \) with projection \( R \) on \( xy \)-plane is a simple \( xy \)-solid. (A) fits this. (B) and (C) describe regions in \( xy \)-plane, not solids in 3D. (D) is not necessarily simple.



#### 18. When evaluating a triple integral over a solid bounded by a cylinder and a plane, which coordinate system is often most convenient?

**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:** Cylindrical coordinates simplify integration over cylinders.



#### 19. Which of the following statements about the projection of a solid \( G \) onto coordinate planes is true?

**Correct:** B, C  
**Explanation:** Projections help determine limits for integration (B), and projections onto \( yz \) or \( zx \) planes can be used to set up integrals with different orders (C). (A) and (D) are false.



#### 20. Consider the triple integral

\[
\iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV
\]

where \( G \) is bounded by \( x^2 + y^2 \leq 4 \), \( 0 \leq z \leq 3 \), and \( y \geq 0 \). Which of the following describes the limits in cylindrical coordinates?

**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:** \( y \geq 0 \) restricts \( \theta \) to \( [0, \pi] \), radius \( r \) from 0 to 2, and \( z \) from 0 to 3.
