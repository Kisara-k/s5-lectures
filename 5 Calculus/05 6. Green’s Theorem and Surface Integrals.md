## 6. Green’s Theorem and Surface Integrals

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on your lecture content on **Green’s Theorem and Surface Integrals**. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step. I’ve used emojis and numbered main headings for clarity and structure.



## 1. 🟢 Green’s Theorem: Connecting Line Integrals and Double Integrals

Green’s Theorem is a fundamental result in vector calculus that relates a line integral around a simple closed curve to a double integral over the region it encloses. This theorem provides a powerful way to convert complicated line integrals into easier double integrals, or vice versa.

#### What is Green’s Theorem?

Suppose you have a region \( D \) in the plane that is **simply connected** (meaning it has no holes) and is bounded by a closed curve \( C \) that is **positively oriented** (traversed counterclockwise). If \( M(x,y) \) and \( N(x,y) \) are functions with continuous partial derivatives on an open set containing \( D \) and its boundary \( C \), then Green’s Theorem states:

\[
\oint_C (M\,dx + N\,dy) = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right) dA
\]

- The left side is a **line integral** around the curve \( C \).
- The right side is a **double integral** over the area \( D \).

This theorem essentially says that the circulation of the vector field \( \mathbf{F} = M\mathbf{i} + N\mathbf{j} \) around the boundary \( C \) equals the total "curl" (or rotation) of the field inside \( D \).

#### Why is this useful?

- It simplifies calculations: sometimes the double integral is easier to evaluate than the line integral.
- It provides insight into the relationship between local properties (curl inside the region) and global properties (circulation around the boundary).

#### Examples from the lecture:

- **Example 1:** Verifying Green’s theorem for the line integral \(\int (-y\,dx + x\,dy)\) over a semicircular path.
- **Example 2:** Calculating work done by a force field \( \mathbf{F}(x,y) = (x + xy^2)\mathbf{i} + 2(x^2 y - y^2 \sin y)\mathbf{j} \) along a closed path.
- **Example 3:** Using Green’s theorem to find the area of an ellipse \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \), showing it equals \( \pi ab \).



## 2. 🔄 Green’s Theorem for Regions with Holes (Doubly and Multiply Connected Regions)

When the region \( R \) is not simply connected but has holes (like a donut shape), Green’s theorem still applies but with a modification.

- The outer boundary \( C_1 \) is oriented counterclockwise.
- The inner boundaries (holes) \( C_2, C_3, \ldots \) are oriented clockwise.

The theorem states:

\[
\iint_R \left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right) dA = \oint_{C_1} (M\,dx + N\,dy) + \oint_{C_2} (M\,dx + N\,dy) + \cdots
\]

where the integrals around holes are taken with opposite orientation.

#### Why does orientation matter?

- The orientation ensures that the region inside the outer boundary is always on the left as you traverse the curve.
- For holes, the opposite orientation accounts for the fact that these boundaries "subtract" area from the region.

#### Example:

- **Example 4:** Evaluate the integral \(\oint -y\,dx + x\,dy / (x^2 + y^2)\) for curves that either enclose or do not enclose the origin. The presence of the origin (a singularity) affects the integral value.



## 3. 🌐 Surface Integrals: Extending Integration to Surfaces in 3D

Surface integrals generalize the idea of integrating functions over curves to integrating over surfaces in three-dimensional space.

#### What is a surface integral?

Given a surface \( \sigma \) in 3D and a scalar function \( f(x,y,z) \), the surface integral sums up the values of \( f \) over every tiny piece of the surface, weighted by the area of that piece.

Formally, if you partition the surface into small pieces with areas \( \Delta s_k \), and pick points \( (x_k^*, y_k^*, z_k^*) \) on each piece, the surface integral is:

\[
\iint_\sigma f(x,y,z) \, dS = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*, y_k^*, z_k^*) \Delta s_k
\]

provided the limit exists and is independent of the partition or choice of points.

#### How do we find the area element \( dS \)?

To compute surface integrals, we need to understand the **normal vector** to the surface, which helps us measure the area element.



## 4. 📐 Normal Vectors to Surfaces in 3D

The normal vector is a vector perpendicular to the surface at a given point. It is crucial for defining surface integrals and flux.

#### How to find the normal vector?

- **Parametric surfaces:** If the surface is given by a parametric vector function

\[
\mathbf{r}(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v))
\]

then the normal vector is the cross product of the partial derivatives:

\[
\mathbf{N} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v}
\]

- **Implicit surfaces:** If the surface is defined by an equation \( G(x,y,z) = 0 \), then the gradient vector

\[
\mathbf{N} = \nabla G = \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial G}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial G}{\partial z}\right)
\]

is normal to the surface.

- **Graphs of functions:** For surfaces given by \( z = g(x,y) \), an upward-pointing normal vector is

\[
\mathbf{N} = \left(-\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}, -\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}, 1\right)
\]

#### Smooth and piecewise smooth surfaces

- A surface is **smooth** if it has a well-defined, non-zero normal vector at every point.
- It is **piecewise smooth** if it is made up of a finite number of smooth pieces joined together.



## 5. 📊 Calculating Surface Integrals Using Parametrization

If the surface \( \sigma \) is parametrized by \( \mathbf{r}(u,v) \) over a region \( R \) in the \( uv \)-plane, and \( f \) is continuous on \( \sigma \), then the surface integral can be computed as:

\[
\iint_\sigma f(x,y,z) \, dS = \iint_R f(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) \left\| \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v} \right\| du\, dv
\]

This formula converts the surface integral into a double integral over the parameter domain \( R \), where the magnitude of the cross product gives the area scaling factor.

#### Examples:

- **Example 5:** Evaluate \( \iint x^2 \, dS \) over the unit sphere \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \).
- **Example 6:** Evaluate \( \iint y^2 z^2 \, dS \) over the part of the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) between \( z=1 \) and \( z=2 \).



## 6. 🧮 Surface Integrals for Surfaces Given as Graphs

If the surface is given explicitly as \( z = g(x,y) \), and \( f \), \( g \), and their partial derivatives are continuous over a region \( R \) in the \( xy \)-plane, then the surface integral is:

\[
\iint_\sigma f(x,y,z) \, dS = \iint_R f(x,y,g(x,y)) \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)^2 + 1} \, dA
\]

This formula uses the projection of the surface onto the \( xy \)-plane and adjusts for the slope of the surface.

#### Example:

- **Example 7:** Evaluate \( \iint f \, dS \) where \( f(x,y,z) = xz + 2x^2 - 3xy \) and \( \sigma \) is the portion of the plane \( 2x - 3y + z = 6 \) over the square \( 2 \leq x \leq 3, 2 \leq y \leq 3 \).



## 7. 🌟 Applications: Orientation and Flux of Vector Fields Through Surfaces

#### What is orientation of a surface?

- A surface is **orientable** if it has two distinct sides (like a sphere or a plane).
- It is **non-orientable** if it has only one side (like a Möbius strip).

For orientable surfaces, we can assign a **unit normal vector** \( \mathbf{n} \) continuously over the surface, which defines the surface’s **orientation**.

- The **positive orientation** is given by \( \mathbf{n} \).
- The **negative orientation** is given by \( -\mathbf{n} \).

#### What is flux?

Flux measures how much of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) passes through a surface per unit time. Imagine fluid flowing through a surface:

- The faster the fluid, the greater the flux.
- The more perpendicular the flow is to the surface, the greater the flux.
- The larger the surface area, the greater the flux.

Mathematically, the flux of \( \mathbf{F} \) across a surface \( \sigma \) with unit normal \( \mathbf{n} \) is:

\[
\Phi = \iint_\sigma \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

- Positive flux means net flow outwards.
- Negative flux means net flow inwards.
- Zero flux means equal flow in both directions.

#### Calculating flux using parametrization:

If \( \sigma \) is parametrized by \( \mathbf{r}(u,v) \), then

\[
\Phi = \iint_R \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) \cdot \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v} \right) du\, dv
\]

#### Example:

- **Example 8:** Find the flux of \( \mathbf{F}(x,y,z) = z \mathbf{k} \) across the outward-oriented sphere \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = a^2 \).



## 8. 🔄 Orientation of Non-Parametric Surfaces and Flux Calculation

Surfaces given by equations like \( z = g(x,y) \), \( y = g(z,x) \), or \( x = g(y,z) \) can be treated as level surfaces of functions \( G(x,y,z) = 0 \).

- The gradient \( \nabla G \) is normal to the surface.
- The flux integral can be expressed as:

\[
\Phi = \iint_R \mathbf{F} \cdot \nabla G \, dA
\]

where \( R \) is the projection of the surface onto the coordinate plane of the independent variables.

This approach simplifies flux calculations for surfaces defined implicitly or explicitly.



## Summary

- **Green’s Theorem** connects line integrals around closed curves to double integrals over the enclosed region.
- It extends to multiply connected regions with holes, requiring careful orientation.
- **Surface integrals** generalize integration to curved surfaces in 3D, requiring normal vectors to measure area elements.
- Normal vectors can be found via parametrization, implicit functions, or explicit graphs.
- **Flux** measures the flow of a vector field through a surface, depending on the field, surface orientation, and area.
- Orientation is crucial for defining positive and negative directions on surfaces.
- Parametric and non-parametric surfaces have formulas to compute surface integrals and flux integrals efficiently.

#### 18. The surface integral of a function \( f \) over a surface \( \sigma \) defined by \( z = g(x,y) \) can be expressed as a double integral over the projection \( R \) on the \( xy \)-plane by multiplying \( f \) by:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
The surface element includes the factor \( \sqrt{1 + g_x^2 + g_y^2} \).



#### 19. Which of the following statements about the flux integral \( \Phi = \iint_\sigma \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS \) are correct?  
**Correct:** A, C, D  
**Explanation:**  
- Flux measures net flow through the surface (A).  
- Flux can be zero if flow is tangent everywhere (C).  
- Flux depends on orientation (D).  
- Flux is not always positive (B is false).



#### 20. When computing the flux of \( \mathbf{F} = z \mathbf{k} \) across the sphere \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = a^2 \), which of the following approaches is valid?  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- Parametrization and cross product formula (A) is valid.  
- Symmetry arguments (B) can show the flux is zero because positive and negative contributions cancel.  
- Expressing as \( z = g(x,y) \) and using surface integral formula (D) is valid.  
- Green’s theorem (C) applies to planar regions, not surfaces in 3D, so it is invalid here.
