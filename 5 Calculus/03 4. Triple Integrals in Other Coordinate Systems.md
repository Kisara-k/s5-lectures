## 4. Triple Integrals in Other Coordinate Systems

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on your lecture content about triple integrals in other coordinate systems and transformations. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the concepts deeply.



## 1. üåê Introduction to Triple Integrals in Other Coordinate Systems

When working with triple integrals, sometimes the standard rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates \((x, y, z)\) are not the easiest or most natural way to describe a region or function. For example, when dealing with spheres or cones, spherical or cylindrical coordinates often simplify the problem. This section introduces how to express and evaluate triple integrals in spherical coordinates and how to perform variable transformations using Jacobians.



## 2. üîµ Spherical Coordinate System: Understanding the Basics

The spherical coordinate system is a way to describe points in three-dimensional space using three parameters: \(\rho\), \(\phi\), and \(\theta\).

- \(\rho\) (rho) is the distance from the origin to the point.
- \(\phi\) (phi) is the angle measured from the positive \(z\)-axis down toward the \(xy\)-plane (polar angle).
- \(\theta\) (theta) is the angle measured in the \(xy\)-plane from the positive \(x\)-axis (azimuthal angle).

The relationships between spherical coordinates \((\rho, \phi, \theta)\) and Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\) are:

\[
x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta
\]
\[
y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta
\]
\[
z = \rho \cos \phi
\]

This system is especially useful for regions that are naturally spherical or radially symmetric.



## 3. üì¶ Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates: Definition and Formula

#### What is a triple integral in spherical coordinates?

A triple integral calculates the volume (or other quantities) over a three-dimensional region. When using spherical coordinates, the volume element \(dV\) is not simply \(d\rho d\phi d\theta\) because the coordinates are curvilinear. Instead, the volume element accounts for the geometry of spherical wedges.

#### Volume element in spherical coordinates

The volume of a small "wedge" in spherical coordinates is:

\[
\Delta V_k = \rho_k^{*2} \sin \phi_k^{*} \Delta \rho_k \Delta \phi_k \Delta \theta_k
\]

Here, \(\rho_k^{*}\), \(\phi_k^{*}\), and \(\theta_k^{*}\) are sample points in the small wedge, and \(\Delta \rho_k\), \(\Delta \phi_k\), \(\Delta \theta_k\) are small increments in each coordinate.

#### Definition of the triple integral in spherical coordinates

The triple integral of a function \(f(\rho, \theta, \phi)\) over a region \(G\) is defined as the limit of sums of function values times the volume of wedges:

\[
\iiint_G f(\rho, \theta, \phi) \, dV = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n f(\rho_k^{*}, \theta_k^{*}, \phi_k^{*}) \Delta V_k
\]

#### Theorem: Evaluating triple integrals in spherical coordinates

The triple integral can be written as an iterated integral:

\[
\iiint_G f(\rho, \theta, \phi) \, dV = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \int_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2} \int_{\rho_1}^{\rho_2} f(\rho, \theta, \phi) \, \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
\]

The factor \(\rho^2 \sin \phi\) comes from the volume element in spherical coordinates.



## 4. üîÑ Converting Triple Integrals from Cartesian to Spherical Coordinates

Sometimes, you start with a triple integral in Cartesian coordinates:

\[
\iiint f(x, y, z) \, dV_{xyz}
\]

To convert this to spherical coordinates, substitute the expressions for \(x, y, z\) in terms of \(\rho, \phi, \theta\), and multiply by the volume element factor:

\[
\iiint f(x, y, z) \, dV = \int \int \int f(\rho \sin \phi \cos \theta, \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta, \rho \cos \phi) \, \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
\]

This transformation simplifies integration over spherical regions.



## 5. üìö Examples of Using Spherical Coordinates

#### Example 1: Volume of a sphere

Using spherical coordinates, you can prove the formula for the volume of a sphere of radius \(R\):

\[
V = \iiint_{\rho \leq R} dV = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \int_0^R \rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta
\]

Evaluating this integral step-by-step yields the well-known volume formula:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3
\]

#### Example 2: Converting a complicated integral

Given an integral like:

\[
I = \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \int_0^{\sqrt{2 - x^2 - y^2}} (x^2 + y^2) \, dz \, dy \, dx
\]

Converting to spherical coordinates simplifies the limits and the integrand, making the integral easier to evaluate.



## 6. üîÑ Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals: The Role of Jacobians

When changing variables in integrals, especially multiple integrals, we need to account for how the area or volume elements change under the transformation. This is where the Jacobian determinant comes in.



## 7. üîë Understanding Transformations and Jacobians in Two Variables

#### What is a transformation?

A transformation \(T\) maps points \((u, v)\) in the \(uv\)-plane to points \((x, y)\) in the \(xy\)-plane via:

\[
x = x(u, v), \quad y = y(u, v)
\]

The image of a set \(S\) in the \(uv\)-plane under \(T\) is the set \(R\) in the \(xy\)-plane.

If each point in \(uv\)-plane maps to a unique point in \(xy\)-plane (one-to-one), then \(T\) has an inverse \(T^{-1}\).

#### Visualizing transformations

- Horizontal lines in the \(uv\)-plane map to curves called constant \(v\)-curves in the \(xy\)-plane.
- Vertical lines in the \(uv\)-plane map to constant \(u\)-curves in the \(xy\)-plane.

#### Jacobian in two variables

The Jacobian determinant measures how area scales under the transformation:

\[
J(u, v) = \frac{\partial(x, y)}{\partial(u, v)} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}
\end{vmatrix}
= \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} - \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}
\]



## 8. üîÑ Change of Variables Formula for Double Integrals

If \(T\) maps region \(S\) in the \(uv\)-plane to region \(R\) in the \(xy\)-plane, and the Jacobian \(J(u,v)\) is non-zero and does not change sign, then:

\[
\iint_R f(x, y) \, dA_{xy} = \iint_S f(x(u,v), y(u,v)) \, |J(u,v)| \, dA_{uv}
\]

This formula allows you to evaluate integrals over complicated regions by transforming them into simpler regions.



## 9. üîë Jacobians and Change of Variables in Three Variables

#### Transformation in three variables

A transformation \(T\) from \((u, v, w)\) to \((x, y, z)\) is given by:

\[
x = x(u, v, w), \quad y = y(u, v, w), \quad z = z(u, v, w)
\]

#### Jacobian in three variables

The Jacobian determinant for three variables is:

\[
J(u, v, w) = \frac{\partial(x, y, z)}{\partial(u, v, w)} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial w} \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial w} \\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial w}
\end{vmatrix}
\]

This determinant measures how volume scales under the transformation.



## 10. üîÑ Change of Variables Formula for Triple Integrals

If \(T\) maps region \(S\) in \((u, v, w)\)-space to region \(R\) in \((x, y, z)\)-space, and the Jacobian \(J(u,v,w)\) is non-zero and does not change sign, then:

\[
\iiint_R f(x, y, z) \, dV_{xyz} = \iiint_S f(x(u,v,w), y(u,v,w), z(u,v,w)) \, |J(u,v,w)| \, dV_{uvw}
\]

This formula is essential for evaluating triple integrals over complicated regions by transforming them into simpler coordinate systems.

\[
x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta, \quad y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta, \quad z = \rho \cos \phi
\]  
Option B is incorrect because it swaps \(\cos \phi\) and \(\sin \phi\) for \(y\). Option D is incorrect because \(x\) depends on \(\sin \phi\), not \(\cos \phi\).



#### 2. In spherical coordinates, the angle \(\phi\) is measured as:

**Correct:** A) The Jacobian can be negative, but volume must be positive.  
D) It ensures the integral accounts for orientation reversal.
