## 11. Complex Integration (ctd.), Taylor and Laurent Series

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on your lecture content on **Complex Integration (continued), Taylor and Laurent Series**. The explanations are clear and thorough, avoiding overly academic jargon, and include emojis for easy navigation.



### 1. 🧮 Fundamental Theorems of Complex Integration

When studying complex integration, a key starting point is understanding how integrals of analytic functions behave in complex domains. Here, the domain is **simply connected**, meaning it has no holes, which is important for the theorems to hold.

#### Indefinite Integrals (Antiderivatives)

If a function \( f \) is **analytic** (complex differentiable everywhere) in a simply connected domain \( D \), then for any fixed point \( z_0 \in D \), the function

\[
F(z) := \int_{C_z} f(\zeta) \, d\zeta
\]

where \( C_z \) is any contour in \( D \) starting at \( z_0 \) and ending at \( z \), is itself analytic in \( D \). Moreover, the derivative of \( F \) is exactly \( f \):

\[
F'(z) = f(z).
\]

This means that \( F \) acts as an **antiderivative** of \( f \) in the complex plane, similar to the fundamental theorem of calculus in real analysis.

#### Definite Integrals and Antiderivatives

If \( f \) is analytic in a simply connected domain \( D \), and \( z_0, z_1 \in D \), then the integral of \( f \) along any contour from \( z_0 \) to \( z_1 \) depends only on the endpoints, not the path:

\[
\int_{z_0}^{z_1} f(z) \, dz = F(z_1) - F(z_0),
\]

where \( F \) is any antiderivative of \( f \).

This is a powerful result because it means complex integrals of analytic functions are **path-independent** in simply connected domains.



### 2. 🔄 Integral Representation for Analytic Functions (Cauchy's Integral Formula)

One of the most important results in complex analysis is **Cauchy's Integral Formula**, which provides a way to represent the value of an analytic function inside a contour in terms of an integral over the contour.

#### Cauchy's Integral Formula

If \( f \) is analytic in a simply connected domain \( D \), and \( C \) is a simple closed contour inside \( D \) oriented positively (counterclockwise), then for any point \( z_0 \) inside \( C \):

\[
f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} \, dz.
\]

This formula tells us that the value of \( f \) at \( z_0 \) can be recovered exactly by integrating \( f \) around a loop enclosing \( z_0 \).

#### Cauchy's Integral Formula for Derivatives

This formula extends to derivatives of \( f \). For the \( n \)-th derivative of \( f \) at \( z_0 \):

\[
f^{(n)}(z_0) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{(z - z_0)^{n+1}} \, dz.
\]

This means all derivatives of an analytic function can be expressed as contour integrals, which is a remarkable property unique to complex analysis.



### 3. 📈 Taylor and Laurent Series: Representing Analytic Functions as Power Series

#### Pointwise and Uniform Convergence of Function Sequences

Before diving into series expansions, it's important to understand how sequences of functions converge.

- **Pointwise convergence** means that for each fixed point \( z \), the sequence \( f_n(z) \) approaches \( f(z) \) as \( n \to \infty \).
- **Uniform convergence** is stronger: the sequence \( f_n \) converges to \( f \) uniformly if, after some index \( N \), all functions \( f_n \) are within any small tolerance \( \epsilon \) of \( f \) for *all* points \( z \) in the domain simultaneously.

Uniform convergence guarantees that limits and integrals can be interchanged safely, which is crucial for working with power series.

#### Power Series and Radius of Convergence

A **power series** centered at \( \alpha \) is:

\[
f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (z - \alpha)^n,
\]

where \( c_n \) are complex coefficients.

The series converges in one of three ways:

- Only at the point \( z = \alpha \),
- Inside a disk \( D_\rho(\alpha) = \{ z : |z - \alpha| < \rho \} \),
- Or everywhere in the complex plane.

The number \( \rho \) is called the **radius of convergence**. Inside this radius, the series converges uniformly on any smaller closed disk.

#### Taylor and Maclaurin Series

If \( f \) is analytic at \( \alpha \), it can be represented by its **Taylor series**:

\[
f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(k)}(\alpha)}{k!} (z - \alpha)^k.
\]

When \( \alpha = 0 \), this is called the **Maclaurin series**.

Taylor's theorem guarantees that this series converges to \( f(z) \) inside the largest disk centered at \( \alpha \) contained in the domain of analyticity.



### 4. 🔍 Properties and Operations on Power Series

#### Uniqueness and Manipulation

- The power series representation of an analytic function is **unique**.
- If two power series represent the same function in a disk, their coefficients must be equal.
- Power series can be added, multiplied, and scaled term-by-term, with the radius of convergence at least the minimum of the involved series.

#### Cauchy Product

The product of two power series \( f(z) = \sum a_n (z-\alpha)^n \) and \( g(z) = \sum b_n (z-\alpha)^n \) is given by the **Cauchy product**:

\[
f(z)g(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (z-\alpha)^n, \quad \text{where} \quad c_n = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}.
\]

This allows us to multiply series systematically.



### 5. 🌀 Laurent Series: Extending Power Series to Annuli

Sometimes, a function is analytic not in a disk but in an **annulus** (a ring-shaped region):

\[
A(r, R, \alpha) = \{ z : r < |z - \alpha| < R \}.
\]

In such cases, the function can be represented by a **Laurent series**, which includes both positive and negative powers:

\[
f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty c_n (z - \alpha)^n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_{-n} (z - \alpha)^{-n} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (z - \alpha)^n.
\]

This series converges uniformly on any closed sub-annulus inside \( A(r, R, \alpha) \).

#### Laurent's Theorem

If \( f \) is analytic in an annulus \( A(r, R, \alpha) \), then it has a unique Laurent series representation there. The coefficients \( c_n \) can be computed by contour integrals around circles inside the annulus:

\[
c_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C_\rho^+(\alpha)} \frac{f(z)}{(z - \alpha)^{n+1}} \, dz,
\]

where \( C_\rho^+(\alpha) \) is the positively oriented circle of radius \( \rho \) with \( r < \rho < R \).

#### Differentiation

The Laurent series can be differentiated term-by-term within the annulus, and the resulting series represents the derivative of \( f \).



### 6. 📝 Summary of Key Concepts and Examples

- **Cauchy's integral formula** allows us to recover function values and derivatives from contour integrals.
