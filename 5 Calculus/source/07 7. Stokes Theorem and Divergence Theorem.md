## 7. Stokes Theorem and Divergence Theorem

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on the lecture content you provided. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts of **Stokes' Theorem** and the **Divergence Theorem** without skipping any important details.



### 1. üåÄ Introduction to Stokes' Theorem

Stokes' Theorem is a fundamental result in vector calculus that connects the circulation of a vector field around a closed curve to the curl of the vector field over the surface bounded by that curve. This theorem generalizes Green's Theorem from the plane to surfaces in three-dimensional space.

#### What is Stokes' Theorem?

Imagine you have a smooth surface, like a curved sheet, which is bounded by a closed loop (a curve that starts and ends at the same point without crossing itself). Stokes' Theorem tells us that the total "circulation" of a vector field along this boundary curve is equal to the total "curl" of the vector field passing through the surface.

More formally:

- Let **œÉ** be a piecewise smooth, oriented surface.
- Let **C** be the simple, closed, piecewise smooth curve that forms the boundary of **œÉ**.
- Let **F** be a vector field with components \( f(x,y,z), g(x,y,z), h(x,y,z) \) that are continuous and have continuous first partial derivatives on an open set containing **œÉ**.
- Let **n** be the unit normal vector to the surface **œÉ**.

Then Stokes' Theorem states:

\[
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_\sigma (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

Here:

- The left side, \(\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}\), is the line integral of **F** around the curve **C**.
- The right side, \(\iint_\sigma (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS\), is the surface integral of the curl of **F** over the surface **œÉ**.

#### Intuition Behind Stokes' Theorem

Think of the vector field **F** as representing a fluid flow. The line integral around the boundary curve measures how much the fluid "circulates" around the curve. The curl of **F** at a point measures the tendency of the fluid to rotate or swirl around that point. Stokes' Theorem says that the total circulation around the boundary is equal to the sum of all the tiny rotations (curls) inside the surface.



### 2. üîÑ Examples of Stokes' Theorem

#### Example 1: Line Integral Around a Curve of Intersection

Evaluate the line integral

\[
\oint_C (2y^2 \, dx + z \, dy + x \, dz)
\]

where **C** is the curve formed by the intersection of the plane \( x + z = 1 \) and the ellipsoid \( x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = 1 \), oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above.

**Approach:**

- Use Stokes' Theorem to convert the line integral into a surface integral of the curl of **F** over the surface bounded by **C**.
- Find the curl of **F**.
- Parameterize or describe the surface bounded by **C**.
- Compute the surface integral of the curl dotted with the unit normal vector.

This approach simplifies the problem by turning a potentially complicated line integral into a surface integral, which is often easier to evaluate.



#### Example 2: Surface Integral of Curl Over a Paraboloid

Evaluate

\[
\iint_\sigma (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

where \(\mathbf{F} = x \mathbf{i} + y^2 \mathbf{j} + z e^{xy} \mathbf{k}\) and \(\sigma\) is the part of the surface \( z = 1 - x^2 - 2y^2 \) with \( z \geq 0 \).

**Approach:**

- Calculate the curl of **F**.
- Determine the unit normal vector **n** for the surface.
- Set up the surface integral over the given paraboloid.
- Evaluate the integral.



### 3. üîó Relationship Between Green's Theorem and Stokes' Theorem

Green's Theorem is a special case of Stokes' Theorem applied to flat surfaces in the plane.

- If the vector field **F** has zero \(k\)-component (i.e., \(F = f(x,y) \mathbf{i} + g(x,y) \mathbf{j} + 0 \mathbf{k}\)),
- And the surface **œÉ** lies flat in the xy-plane,
- Then the surface integral over **œÉ** reduces to a double integral over the region \(R\) in the plane,
- And the line integral around the boundary curve \(C\) corresponds to the circulation in Green's Theorem.

This shows how Stokes' Theorem generalizes Green's Theorem to curved surfaces in three dimensions.



### 4. üåä Introduction to the Divergence Theorem

The Divergence Theorem is another powerful result in vector calculus that relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the divergence of the vector field inside the volume bounded by that surface.

#### What is the Divergence Theorem?

Imagine a closed surface (like a sphere or a cube) enclosing a solid region \(R\). The Divergence Theorem states that the total flux of a vector field **F** outward through the surface is equal to the total divergence of **F** inside the volume.

Formally:

- Let **œÉ** be a smooth, orientable closed surface enclosing a solid region \(R\) in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
- Let **F** be a vector field with continuous components and continuous partial derivatives on an open set containing \(R\).
- Let **n** be the outward unit normal vector on **œÉ**.

Then:

\[
\iint_\sigma \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS = \iiint_R \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dV
\]

Here:

- The left side is the surface integral of **F** over the closed surface **œÉ**, measuring the total flux out of the volume.
- The right side is the triple integral of the divergence of **F** over the volume \(R\).

#### Intuition Behind the Divergence Theorem

If you think of **F** as a fluid velocity field, the flux through the surface measures how much fluid is flowing out of the volume. The divergence at a point measures how much the fluid is "spreading out" or "converging" at that point. The Divergence Theorem says that the total outward flow through the surface equals the sum of all the sources and sinks inside the volume.



### 5. üìê Examples of the Divergence Theorem

#### Example 3: Flux Through a Tetrahedron

Evaluate

\[
\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

where \(\mathbf{F} = x^2 \mathbf{i} + xy \mathbf{j} + x^3 y^3 \mathbf{k}\), and \(S\) is the surface of the tetrahedron bounded by the plane \(x + y + z = 1\) and the coordinate planes, with outward normal vector.

**Approach:**

- Calculate the divergence \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}\).
- Set up the triple integral over the tetrahedron volume.
- Evaluate the integral to find the total flux.



#### Example 4: Flux Through Part of a Cube

Evaluate

\[
\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

where \(\mathbf{F} = xy \mathbf{i} - z^2 \mathbf{k}\), and \(S\) is the upper five faces of the unit cube \([0,1]^3\).

**Approach:**

- Since the surface is not closed (missing the bottom face), you cannot directly apply the Divergence Theorem.
- You can either compute the flux directly over the five faces or close the surface by adding the missing face and use the Divergence Theorem, then subtract the flux through the missing face.



### 6. üåü Understanding Divergence as Flux Density

The divergence of a vector field at a point can be interpreted as the "flux density" or the net rate at which the vector field is "flowing out" of an infinitesimally small volume around that point.

#### Explanation:

- Consider a small spherical region \(G\) centered at a point \(P_0\).
- The surface of this small sphere is \(\sigma(G)\), oriented outward.
- The volume of \(G\) is \(\text{vol}(G)\).
- The flux of **F** across \(\sigma(G)\) is \(\phi(G) = \iint_{\sigma(G)} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS\).

If the divergence \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}\) is continuous near \(P_0\), then over the small region \(G\), the divergence is approximately constant and equal to \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}(P_0)\).

Thus,

\[
\phi(G) \approx \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}(P_0) \times \text{vol}(G)
\]

Rearranging,

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}(P_0) \approx \frac{\phi(G)}{\text{vol}(G)}
\]

Taking the limit as the volume shrinks to zero,

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}(P_0) = \lim_{\text{vol}(G) \to 0} \frac{\iint_{\sigma(G)} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS}{\text{vol}(G)}
\]

This limit defines the divergence at the point \(P_0\) as the flux per unit volume, giving a physical meaning: **divergence measures how much the vector field is "spreading out" from a point**.



## Summary

- **Stokes' Theorem** relates the circulation of a vector field around a closed curve to the curl of the vector field over the surface bounded by that curve.
- **Green's Theorem** is a special case of Stokes' Theorem for flat surfaces in the plane.
- **The Divergence Theorem** relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the divergence of the vector field inside the volume bounded by that surface.
- Divergence can be interpreted as the flux density, or the net outward flow per unit volume at a point.

These theorems are essential tools in vector calculus, providing powerful ways to convert between line integrals, surface integrals, and volume integrals, which simplifies many problems in physics and engineering.
