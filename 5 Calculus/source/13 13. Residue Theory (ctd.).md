## 13. Residue Theory (ctd.)

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on the lecture content you provided on Residue Theory, focusing on evaluating real integrals using residues. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step.



### 1. 🧮 Introduction to Residue Theory and Real Integrals

Residue theory is a powerful tool in complex analysis that allows us to evaluate complex contour integrals by examining the singularities (poles) of a function inside a contour. While initially developed for complex integrals, residue theory can also be cleverly applied to evaluate certain real integrals that are difficult or impossible to solve using standard calculus techniques.

Throughout this course, you have learned that integrals over curves in three-dimensional space or contours in the complex plane can often be transformed into integrals over real intervals by suitable parametrizations. This process can be reversed: by extending real integrals into the complex plane and using residues, we can evaluate real integrals that are otherwise challenging.



### 2. 🎯 Evaluating Real Integrals Using Residues

The key idea is to consider a real integral as part of a complex integral over a contour in the complex plane. By choosing an appropriate contour and applying the residue theorem, we can express the value of the real integral in terms of the residues of the function’s poles inside the contour.

This approach is especially useful for:

- Improper integrals over infinite intervals.
- Integrals involving rational functions.
- Integrals involving trigonometric functions multiplied by rational functions.



### 3. 🔄 Trigonometric Integrals and Residues

Trigonometric integrals often appear in the form of integrals involving sine and cosine functions. Using residue theory, these can be evaluated by expressing the trigonometric functions in terms of complex exponentials (Euler’s formula):

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta}}{2}, \quad \sin \theta = \frac{e^{i\theta} - e^{-i\theta}}{2i}
\]

**Examples:**

1. \(\int_0^{2\pi} (1 + 3 \cos^2 \theta) d\theta = \pi\)

2. \(\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{5 - 4 \cos \theta} d\theta = 6\)

These integrals can be tackled by converting the trigonometric expressions into complex exponentials and then applying residue theory to evaluate the resulting contour integrals.



### 4. ♾️ Improper Integrals of Rational Functions

Improper integrals are integrals where the interval of integration is infinite or the integrand has singularities. Residue theory provides a systematic way to evaluate such integrals when the integrand is a rational function (a ratio of polynomials).

#### Definition of Improper Integral

- For a function \(f\) continuous on \([0, \infty)\), the improper integral is defined as:

\[
\int_0^\infty f(x) \, dx := \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b f(x) \, dx
\]

- For a function \(f\) defined on all real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\), the integral over \((-\infty, \infty)\) is:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \, dx := \lim_{a \to -\infty} \int_a^0 f(x) \, dx + \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b f(x) \, dx
\]

- The **Cauchy Principal Value (P.V.)** is a special way to assign a value to some improper integrals that might not converge in the usual sense:

\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \, dx := \lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{-R}^R f(x) \, dx
\]

This is useful when the integral is symmetric but does not converge absolutely.

**Example:**

\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, dx = \lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{-R}^R x \, dx = \lim_{R \to \infty} 0 = 0
\]

Note that the usual integral \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, dx\) does not exist, but the principal value does.



### 5. 📜 Theorems on Evaluating Improper Integrals Using Residues

#### Theorem 13.3.1: Rational Functions Without Real Poles

Let \(f(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}\), where \(P\) and \(Q\) are polynomials of degrees \(m\) and \(n\) respectively. Suppose:

- \(Q(x) \neq 0\) for all real \(x\) (no real poles).
- \(n \geq m + 2\) (degree of denominator at least two more than numerator).

Then the Cauchy principal value of the integral over the entire real line is:

\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \, dx = 2\pi i \sum \text{Residues of } \frac{P}{Q} \text{ at poles in the upper half-plane}
\]

**Explanation:**

- The condition \(n \geq m + 2\) ensures the function decays fast enough at infinity for the integral to converge.
- The poles in the upper half-plane are the singularities of the function where the denominator \(Q(z) = 0\).
- The sum of residues at these poles, multiplied by \(2\pi i\), gives the value of the integral.

**Examples:**

- \(P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x^2 + 1}{(x^2 + 4)^3} dx\)
- \(P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{(x^2 + 4)^3}{256} dx\)

These can be evaluated by finding the poles of the integrand in the upper half-plane and calculating their residues.



#### Theorem 13.3.2: Integrals Involving Cosine and Sine

If \(P\) and \(Q\) are polynomials with degrees \(m\) and \(n\) respectively, and \(n \geq m + 1\), with no real zeros of \(Q\), then the integrals

\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \cos x \, dx \quad \text{and} \quad P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \sin x \, dx
\]

are convergent improper integrals.

This theorem guarantees convergence but does not provide the explicit value.



#### Theorem 13.3.3: Evaluating Integrals with Exponential Factors

Let \(P\) and \(Q\) be polynomials with degrees \(m\) and \(n\) respectively, \(n \geq m + 1\), and \(Q(x) \neq 0\) for all real \(x\). Define

\[
f(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)} e^{i \alpha z}
\]

where \(\alpha > 0\). Then:

\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \cos(\alpha x) \, dx = -2\pi \sum \operatorname{Im}(\text{Residues of } f \text{ at poles in upper half-plane})
\]

\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \sin(\alpha x) \, dx = 2\pi \sum \operatorname{Re}(\text{Residues of } f \text{ at poles in upper half-plane})
\]

**Explanation:**

- The exponential factor \(e^{i \alpha z}\) encodes the trigonometric functions via Euler’s formula.
- The residues of \(f\) at poles in the upper half-plane determine the value of the integrals.
- The imaginary and real parts of these residues correspond to cosine and sine integrals respectively.

**Examples:**

- \(P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x \sin x}{x^2 + 4} dx = e^2\)
- \(P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\cos x}{x^4 + 4} dx = \pi (\cos 1 + \sin 1)\)



### 6. 📝 Summary and Key Takeaways

Certainly! Below are the correct answers for each question along with brief explanations.



#### 1. Which of the following statements about the Cauchy Principal Value (P.V.) of an integral are true?  
**Correct:** B, C  
**Explanation:**

- C: By definition, the P.V. is the limit of integrals over symmetric intervals \([-R, R]\) as \(R \to \infty\).  
- A is false because absolute convergence implies usual integral convergence, not just P.V.  
- D is false because P.V. is defined for integrals over infinite intervals as well.



#### 2. For the rational function \(f(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}\), which conditions ensure that \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) dx\) converges absolutely?  
**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:**  
- A: \(n \geq m + 2\) ensures the denominator grows faster than numerator, so the function decays fast enough for absolute convergence.  
- C: \(Q(x) \neq 0\) on \(\mathbb{R}\) avoids singularities on the real axis.

**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:**

- C: The integral over the large semicircle in the upper half-plane tends to zero under suitable conditions.  
- B is false; poles in the lower half-plane do contribute if the contour is closed there.  
- D is false; the function may not be analytic in the lower half-plane.



#### 4. Which of the following integrals can be evaluated using residue theory by expressing trigonometric functions as complex exponentials?  
**Correct:** A, D  
**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**  
- A: Residue is the coefficient of \(\frac{1}{z - z_0}\) in the Laurent series.

- C: The integral converges if \(n \geq m + 1\).  
- B is false (that formula applies to cosine integral).  
- D is false; residue theory can be used.



#### 8. Which of the following integrals does **not** have a Cauchy Principal Value?  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- B: \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, dx\) does not exist and its P.V. is zero, so it technically has a P.V. but the usual integral does not exist. However, since the question asks which does **not** have a P.V., this is tricky. Actually, all except B have P.V.  
- A, C, D have well-defined P.V.s or usual integrals.  
*Note:* This is a tricky question; the integral of \(x\) has a P.V. of zero, so technically all have P.V. The question is ambiguous; if interpreted strictly, none lack P.V. But the usual integral of \(x\) does not exist.



#### 9. The condition \(n \geq m + 2\) in Theorem 13.3.1 ensures:  
**Correct:** A, D

#### 12. In residue theory, what is the main purpose of choosing a semicircular contour in the upper half-plane?  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- The semicircle contour allows the integral over the arc to vanish as radius grows, enabling the use of residue theorem on the real axis.

#### 13. Which of the following functions satisfy \(Q(x) \neq 0\) for all real \(x\)?  
**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:**

- D: The function must have no poles on the contour itself.  
- B is false; the function must be analytic **except** at isolated singularities inside the contour.



#### 16. Suppose \(f(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}\) has poles \(z_1, \ldots, z_k\) in the upper half-plane. Which is true about \(P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) dx\)?
