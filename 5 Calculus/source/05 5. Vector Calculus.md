## 5. Vector Calculus

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on your lecture content on **Vector Calculus**. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step. I‚Äôve structured the note with numbered main headings and used emojis for clarity and engagement.



### 1. üìê Introduction to Vector Fields

Vector calculus begins with the concept of **vector fields**, which are fundamental in describing physical phenomena like fluid flow, electromagnetic fields, and forces.

A **vector field** in three-dimensional space (‚Ñù¬≥) is a function that assigns a vector to every point in a region of space. Formally, if the domain is \( D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3 \), a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) is written as:

\[
\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = M(x, y, z)\mathbf{i} + N(x, y, z)\mathbf{j} + P(x, y, z)\mathbf{k}
\]

Here, \( M, N, P \) are scalar functions representing the components of the vector field along the \( x, y, z \) axes respectively.

- If these component functions are **continuous**, the vector field is called a **continuous vector field**.
- If all partial derivatives of \( M, N, P \) exist, the vector field is **differentiable**.

#### Special Types of Vector Fields

- **Inverse-square field:** A vector field of the form

\[
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{c}{\|\mathbf{r}\|^3} \mathbf{r}
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} \) is the position vector and \( c \) is a constant. This type of field appears in physics, for example in **Coulomb‚Äôs Law** describing electric forces.



### 2. üåü Gradient, Divergence, Curl, and Laplacian

These are key differential operators in vector calculus that help analyze vector fields.

#### Gradient (‚àáœï)

If \( \phi(x, y, z) \) is a scalar function, its **gradient** is a vector field defined as:

\[
\nabla \phi = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \mathbf{j} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} \mathbf{k}
\]

- The gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of \( \phi \).
- The magnitude of the gradient gives the rate of increase in that direction.
- The operator \( \nabla \) (called **del**) is a vector differential operator.

#### Conservative Vector Fields

A vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) is **conservative** if it can be expressed as the gradient of some scalar function \( \phi \):

\[
\mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi
\]

Here, \( \phi \) is called the **potential function** of \( \mathbf{F} \).

#### Divergence (div)

For a vector field

\[
\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = f(x, y, z)\mathbf{i} + g(x, y, z)\mathbf{j} + h(x, y, z)\mathbf{k}
\]

the **divergence** is a scalar function defined as:

\[
\text{div}(\mathbf{F}) = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial h}{\partial z}
\]

- Divergence measures the **net rate of flow** out of a point.
- If divergence is positive at a point, the field behaves like a source there; if negative, like a sink.

#### Curl (‚àá√óF)

The **curl** of \( \mathbf{F} \) is a vector field defined by the cross product of \( \nabla \) and \( \mathbf{F} \):

\[
\text{curl}(\mathbf{F}) = \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
f & g & h
\end{vmatrix}
\]

- Curl measures the **rotation** or swirling strength of the vector field at a point.
- A zero curl means the field is irrotational.

#### Laplacian (‚àá¬≤)

The **Laplacian** operator is defined as the divergence of the gradient:

\[
\nabla^2 = \nabla \cdot \nabla = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}
\]

For a scalar function \( \phi \):

\[
\nabla^2 \phi = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial z^2}
\]

- The equation \( \nabla^2 \phi = 0 \) is called **Laplace‚Äôs equation**, important in physics and engineering for steady-state heat flow, electrostatics, and fluid flow.



### 3. ‚û∞ Line Integrals: Integrating Along Curves

Line integrals extend the idea of integration to functions defined along curves in space.

#### Scalar Line Integrals

If \( f \) is a scalar function defined on a smooth curve \( C \) parameterized by

\[
x = x(t), \quad y = y(t), \quad z = z(t), \quad a \leq t \leq b
\]

then the **line integral** of \( f \) over \( C \) is:

\[
\int_C f(x, y, z) \, ds = \int_a^b f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

- Here, \( ds \) represents an infinitesimal arc length along the curve.
- This integral sums the values of \( f \) weighted by the length of the curve segments.

**Interpretation:** If \( f \) is non-negative and defined on a curve in the plane, the line integral can represent the area of a "curtain" or "sheet" formed by lifting the curve vertically by height \( f(x,y) \).

#### Vector Line Integrals

If \( \mathbf{F} \) is a vector field and \( C \) is a piecewise smooth curve parameterized by \( \mathbf{r}(t) \), the **line integral of \( \mathbf{F} \) along \( C \)** is:

\[
\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_a^b \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) \, dt
\]

- This integral measures the work done by the vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) along the path \( C \).
- The dot product ensures we only consider the component of \( \mathbf{F} \) tangent to the curve.



### 4. üîÑ Independence of Path and Conservative Vector Fields

One of the most important properties in vector calculus is when the value of a line integral depends only on the endpoints of the curve, not the path taken.

#### Work Done by a Force Field

If a particle moves along a curve \( C \) under a force field \( \mathbf{F} \), the **work done** is:

\[
W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
\]

#### Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals

If \( \mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi \) for some scalar function \( \phi \), then for a curve \( C \) from point \( A \) to point \( B \):

\[
\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \phi(B) - \phi(A)
\]

- This means the work done depends only on the values of \( \phi \) at the endpoints.
- Such vector fields are called **conservative**.

#### Closed Curves and Simply Connected Regions

- A **closed curve** is one where the start and end points are the same.
- A region \( D \) is **connected** if any two points in \( D \) can be joined by a curve lying entirely in \( D \).
- A region is **simply connected** if every closed curve in \( D \) encloses only points inside \( D \) (no holes).

#### Equivalence of Conditions for Conservative Fields

In a connected region \( D \), the following are equivalent for a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \):

1. \( \mathbf{F} \) is conservative.
2. The line integral of \( \mathbf{F} \) around every closed curve in \( D \) is zero.
3. The line integral of \( \mathbf{F} \) between any two points in \( D \) is independent of the path taken.

#### Test for Conservative Fields in 2D

For a vector field \( \mathbf{F}(x,y) = f(x,y)\mathbf{i} + g(x,y)\mathbf{j} \) with continuous partial derivatives in a simply connected region \( D \), \( \mathbf{F} \) is conservative if and only if:

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}
\]

This condition ensures the existence of a potential function \( \phi \) such that \( \mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi \).



### 5. üßÆ Examples and Applications

#### Example 1: Line Integral of a Scalar Function

Evaluate

\[
\int_C x^2 z \, ds
\]

where \( C \) is the helix parameterized by

\[
x = \cos t, \quad y = 2t, \quad z = \sin t, \quad 0 \leq t \leq \pi
\]

- Use the formula for \( ds \) and substitute the parametric equations.
- Compute the integral over \( t \).

#### Example 2: Vector Line Integral

Evaluate

\[
\int_C y \, dx - z \, dy + x \, dz
\]

where \( C \) is parameterized by

\[
x = t^2, \quad y = e^{-t}, \quad z = e^t, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 1
\]

- Express \( dx, dy, dz \) in terms of \( dt \).
- Substitute and integrate over \( t \).

#### Example 3: Conservative Field Verification

Show that

\[
\mathbf{F} = (e^x \sin y - y)\mathbf{i} + (e^x \cos y - x - 2)\mathbf{j}
\]

is conservative and find a potential function \( \phi \).

- Check if \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} \).
- Integrate to find \( \phi \).



### Summary

Vector calculus provides powerful tools to analyze vector fields through concepts like gradient, divergence, curl, and line integrals. Understanding when a vector field is conservative allows simplification of line integrals and has important physical interpretations, especially in work and energy calculations. The Laplacian operator and Laplace‚Äôs equation play a crucial role in many physical systems.
