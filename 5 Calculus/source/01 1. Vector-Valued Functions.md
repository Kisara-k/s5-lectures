## 1. Vector-Valued Functions

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized, and clear study note based on your lecture content on **Vector-Valued Functions**. I have expanded explanations, clarified key concepts, and structured the note with numbered main headings and emojis for clarity.



### 1. 🧮 Introduction to Vector-Valued Functions

In calculus and geometry, we often describe curves and shapes using equations. A **vector-valued function** is a powerful way to represent curves in space by expressing each coordinate as a function of a parameter, usually denoted by \( t \). This approach allows us to describe paths, motions, and shapes in two or three dimensions in a unified way.

#### What is a Parametric Equation?

A **parametric equation** expresses a set of quantities as functions of one or more independent variables called **parameters**. Instead of writing \( y \) directly as a function of \( x \), we write both \( x \) and \( y \) as functions of a third variable \( t \).

- **Example:** The parabola \( y = x^2 \) can be rewritten parametrically as:
  \[
  x = t, \quad y = t^2
  \]
  Here, \( t \) runs over all real numbers, and as \( t \) changes, the point \( (x,y) \) traces the parabola.

#### Parametric Forms of Common Curves

- **Circle of radius \( r \):**
  \[
  x = r \cos \theta, \quad y = r \sin \theta
  \]
  Here, \( \theta \) is the parameter, often representing an angle.

- **Circular Helix in 3D:**
  \[
  x = a \cos t, \quad y = a \sin t, \quad z = c t
  \]
  This describes a spiral winding around the \( z \)-axis.

- **Tricuspoid Curve:**
  \[
  x = 2 \cos t + \cos 2t, \quad y = 2 \sin t - \sin 2t
  \]
  This is a more complex curve with three cusps.

#### Defining Vector-Valued Functions

A **vector-valued function** \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) is a function whose output is a vector, typically in 2D or 3D space. It is written as:
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = x(t) \mathbf{i} + y(t) \mathbf{j} + z(t) \mathbf{k}
\]
where \( x(t), y(t), z(t) \) are real-valued functions of the parameter \( t \).

- The functions \( x(t), y(t), z(t) \) are called the **components** of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \).
- The parameter \( t \) usually represents time or another continuous variable.

**Example:** The circular helix can be expressed as:
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t, c t), \quad t \geq 0
\]

#### Domain of Vector-Valued Functions

The **natural domain** of a vector-valued function is the set of all \( t \) values for which all component functions are defined.

- For example, for
  \[
  \mathbf{r}(t) = (\ln|t-1|, e^t, \sqrt{t})
  \]
  the domain requires:
  - \( t \neq 1 \) (since \( \ln|t-1| \) is undefined at \( t=1 \))
  - \( t \geq 0 \) (since \( \sqrt{t} \) requires non-negative \( t \))
  
  So the domain is \( t > 1 \) or \( 0 \leq t < 1 \), excluding \( t=1 \).



### 2. 📐 Calculus of Vector-Valued Functions: Limits and Continuity

Just like real-valued functions, vector-valued functions can be analyzed using limits and continuity, but with vectors instead of numbers.

#### Limits of Vector-Valued Functions

The limit of a vector-valued function \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) as \( t \to a \) is a vector \( \mathbf{L} \) if the vector \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) gets arbitrarily close to \( \mathbf{L} \) as \( t \) approaches \( a \).

Formally, for every small positive number \( \epsilon \), there exists a \( \delta \) such that if \( 0 < |t - a| < \delta \), then the distance between \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) and \( \mathbf{L} \) is less than \( \epsilon \):
\[
\|\mathbf{r}(t) - \mathbf{L}\| < \epsilon
\]

#### Component-wise Limit Evaluation

A key theorem states that the limit of a vector-valued function exists if and only if the limits of each of its components exist. That is:
\[
\lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{L} = (L_1, L_2, L_3)
\]
if and only if
\[
\lim_{t \to a} x(t) = L_1, \quad \lim_{t \to a} y(t) = L_2, \quad \lim_{t \to a} z(t) = L_3
\]

This means we can analyze vector limits by studying each component separately, using familiar real-valued limit techniques.

#### Limit Laws for Vector-Valued Functions

The usual limit laws apply to vector-valued functions, including:

- Sum and difference:
  \[
  \lim_{t \to a} [\mathbf{F}(t) \pm \mathbf{G}(t)] = \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{F}(t) \pm \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{G}(t)
  \]
- Scalar multiplication:
  \[
  \lim_{t \to a} [h(t) \mathbf{F}(t)] = \lim_{t \to a} h(t) \cdot \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{F}(t)
  \]
- Dot product:
  \[
  \lim_{t \to a} [\mathbf{F}(t) \cdot \mathbf{G}(t)] = \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{F}(t) \cdot \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{G}(t)
  \]
- Cross product:
  \[
  \lim_{t \to a} [\mathbf{F}(t) \times \mathbf{G}(t)] = \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{F}(t) \times \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{G}(t)
  \]

#### Continuity of Vector-Valued Functions

A vector-valued function \( \mathbf{r} \) is **continuous** at \( t = a \) if:
- \( a \) is in the domain of \( \mathbf{r} \), and
- The limit of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) as \( t \to a \) equals \( \mathbf{r}(a) \).

Because limits are evaluated component-wise, continuity of \( \mathbf{r} \) at \( a \) means each component function is continuous at \( a \).



### 3. ✍️ Differentiation of Vector-Valued Functions

Differentiation extends naturally to vector-valued functions, allowing us to analyze rates of change of curves and motions in space.

#### Definition of the Derivative

The derivative of a vector-valued function \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) at \( t \) is defined as the limit:
\[
\mathbf{r}'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\mathbf{r}(t+h) - \mathbf{r}(t)}{h}
\]
if this limit exists.

This derivative \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) is itself a vector-valued function, representing the instantaneous rate of change of \( \mathbf{r} \) at \( t \).

#### Component-wise Differentiation

Just like limits, differentiation of vector-valued functions can be done component-wise:
\[
\mathbf{r}'(t) = (x'(t), y'(t), z'(t))
\]
where each component is the derivative of the corresponding component function.

#### Differentiation Rules

The familiar rules of differentiation apply to vector-valued functions:

- The derivative of a constant vector \( \mathbf{c} \) is zero.
- Scalar multiples:
  \[
  \frac{d}{dt}[k \mathbf{r}(t)] = k \mathbf{r}'(t)
  \]
- Sum and difference:
  \[
  \frac{d}{dt}[\mathbf{r}_1(t) \pm \mathbf{r}_2(t)] = \mathbf{r}_1'(t) \pm \mathbf{r}_2'(t)
  \]
- Product with a scalar function \( f(t) \):
  \[
  \frac{d}{dt}[f(t) \mathbf{r}(t)] = f(t) \mathbf{r}'(t) + f'(t) \mathbf{r}(t)
  \]

#### Tangent Vectors and Tangent Lines

If \( \mathbf{r}'(t_0) \) exists and is not the zero vector, it is called a **tangent vector** to the curve at the point \( \mathbf{r}(t_0) \).

- The **tangent line** at \( \mathbf{r}(t_0) \) is the line passing through \( \mathbf{r}(t_0) \) in the direction of \( \mathbf{r}'(t_0) \).
- The parametric equation of the tangent line is:
  \[
  \mathbf{L}(s) = \mathbf{r}(t_0) + s \mathbf{r}'(t_0)
  \]
  where \( s \) is a real parameter.



### 4. 🔄 Differentiation of Dot and Cross Products

Vector-valued functions often involve dot and cross products, and their derivatives follow special product rules.

- **Derivative of dot product:**
  \[
  \frac{d}{dt}[\mathbf{r}_1(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}_2(t)] = \mathbf{r}_1'(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}_2(t) + \mathbf{r}_1(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}_2'(t)
  \]

- **Derivative of cross product:**
  \[
  \frac{d}{dt}[\mathbf{r}_1(t) \times \mathbf{r}_2(t)] = \mathbf{r}_1'(t) \times \mathbf{r}_2(t) + \mathbf{r}_1(t) \times \mathbf{r}_2'(t)
  \]

These rules are analogous to the product rule for scalar functions but adapted for vector operations.



### 5. ⊥ Orthogonality of Vector and Its Derivative

An important geometric property arises when the magnitude of a vector-valued function is constant.

- If \( \|\mathbf{r}(t)\| \) is constant for all \( t \), then the vector \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) is always **orthogonal** (perpendicular) to its derivative \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \).
- Mathematically:
  \[
  \mathbf{r}(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) = 0 \quad \text{for all } t
  \]
  
This means the rate of change of the vector is always perpendicular to the vector itself, which is intuitive for motion along a circle or sphere where the radius vector length remains fixed.



### 6. ∫ Integration of Vector-Valued Functions

Integration of vector-valued functions is done component-wise, just like differentiation.

- If
  \[
  \mathbf{r}(t) = x(t) \mathbf{i} + y(t) \mathbf{j} + z(t) \mathbf{k}
  \]
  then the definite integral over \( [a,b] \) is:
  \[
  \int_a^b \mathbf{r}(t) \, dt = \left( \int_a^b x(t) \, dt \right) \mathbf{i} + \left( \int_a^b y(t) \, dt \right) \mathbf{j} + \left( \int_a^b z(t) \, dt \right) \mathbf{k}
  \]

#### Integration Rules

The usual linearity properties hold:

- Scalar multiplication:
  \[
  \int k \mathbf{r}(t) \, dt = k \int \mathbf{r}(t) \, dt
  \]
- Sum and difference:
  \[
  \int [\mathbf{r}_1(t) \pm \mathbf{r}_2(t)] \, dt = \int \mathbf{r}_1(t) \, dt \pm \int \mathbf{r}_2(t) \, dt
  \]



### 7. ✅ Summary and Key Takeaways

- The **tangent line** at a point is defined using the tangent vector.
- Derivatives of dot and cross products follow special product rules.

- D) \(z = c t\) is a parametric expression for the \(z\)-coordinate in a helix.  
- B) \(y = x^2\) is not parametric; it’s an explicit function.



#### 2. A vector-valued function \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) is defined as \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))\). Which statements are true?

#### 3. The natural domain of \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (\ln|t-1|, e^t, \sqrt{t})\) is:  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- \(\ln|t-1|\) requires \(t \neq 1\).  
- \(\sqrt{t}\) requires \(t \geq 0\).  
- So domain is \(t \geq 0\) excluding \(t=1\).



#### 4. The limit \(\lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{L}\) exists if and only if:  
**Correct:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**

- Continuity (D) is related but not necessary for limit existence.



#### 5. Which of the following limit properties hold for vector-valued functions \(\mathbf{F}(t)\) and \(\mathbf{G}(t)\) and scalar function \(h(t)\)?  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- A, B, D are standard limit laws for vector functions.  
- C is false because dot product limit is not equal to cross product limit.



#### 6. A vector-valued function \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) is continuous at \(t=a\) if:  
**Correct:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**

#### 8. Which of the following differentiation rules for vector-valued functions are correct?  
**Correct:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**  
- A, B, C are standard differentiation rules.

#### 9. The tangent vector to the curve defined by \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) at \(t=t_0\) is:  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- The tangent vector is the derivative \(\mathbf{r}'(t_0)\) if it is nonzero.  
- A and C are position vectors, not tangent vectors.  
- D is false; tangent vector is not necessarily perpendicular to \(\mathbf{r}(t_0)\).



#### 10. The equation of the tangent line to the curve at \(t=t_0\) is:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- The tangent line passes through \(\mathbf{r}(t_0)\) in the direction of \(\mathbf{r}'(t_0)\).  
- B, C, D are incorrect formulations.



#### 11. If \(\mathbf{r}_1(t)\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2(t)\) are differentiable vector-valued functions, then:  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:**  
- A and B are the product rules for dot and cross products.  
- C and D confuse dot and cross product derivatives.



#### 12. If \(\|\mathbf{r}(t)\|\) is constant for all \(t\), then which of the following is true?  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:**  
- Constant magnitude implies \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) and \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\) are orthogonal, so dot product is zero.  
- C and D are not necessarily true.



#### 13. The definite integral of a vector-valued function \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))\) over \([a,b]\) is:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- Integration is done component-wise.  
- B is incorrect because integrals of components are not summed as scalars.  
- C is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus but not the integral itself.  
- D is false.



#### 14. Which of the following integration properties hold for vector-valued functions \(\mathbf{r}_1(t)\), \(\mathbf{r}_2(t)\) and scalar \(k\)?  
**Correct:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**  
- Linearity of integration applies component-wise.  
- D is false; integral of dot product is not product of integrals.



#### 15. Which of the following statements about the derivative of a vector-valued function are true?  
**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:**  
- Derivative exists only if each component is differentiable.  
- Derivative vector points in the tangent direction.  
- B is false; derivative is vector-valued.  
- D is false; derivative zero implies constant function locally.



#### 16. Consider the vector-valued function \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (t^2, \sin t, e^t)\). Which of the following are true?  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- A) Derivative is \((2t, \cos t, e^t)\).  
- B) All components are continuous everywhere.  
- D) At \(t=0\), derivative is \((0,1,1)\).  
- C is false; differentiable for all real \(t\).



#### 17. If \(\mathbf{r}_1(t)\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2(t)\) intersect at the origin, which of the following can be used to find the angle between their tangent lines at that point?  
**Correct:** A, C, D  
**Explanation:**  
- Angle between tangent lines is found using dot product of tangent vectors and their magnitudes.  
- B is irrelevant; cross product of position vectors at origin is zero.



#### 18. Which of the following are true about the continuity class \(C^1\) for a function \(f\)?  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:**  
- \(C^1\) means \(f\) is differentiable and \(f'\) is continuous.  
- C is false; differentiability is required.  
- D describes \(C^2\) class.



#### 19. The vector-valued function \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t, c t)\) represents:  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- This is a helix winding around the \(z\)-axis.  
- A is only the projection in \(xy\)-plane.  
- C and D are incorrect.



#### 20. Which of the following statements about the tangent vector \(\mathbf{r}'(t_0)\) are correct?  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- A) Zero derivative means stationary point.  
- B) Tangent vector defines direction of tangent line.  
- D) Tangent vector relates to slope of curve.  
- C is false; tangent vector is not always perpendicular to \(\mathbf{r}(t_0)\).
