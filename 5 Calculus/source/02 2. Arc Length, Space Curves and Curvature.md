## 2. Arc Length, Space Curves and Curvature

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized, and clear study note based on your lecture content on **Arc Length, Space Curves, and Curvature**. I have expanded explanations, clarified key concepts, and structured the note for easy understanding. Emojis and numbered headings are included for clarity and engagement.



### 1. üìè Arc Length: Measuring the Length of a Curve

When we talk about the length of a curve in three-dimensional space (‚Ñù¬≥), we want a way to measure how long the curve is, much like measuring the length of a piece of string. This is called the **arc length**.

#### What is a Curve?

A curve can be represented by a vector-valued function \(\mathbf{r}(t)\), where \(t\) is a parameter that varies over an interval \([a, b]\). The function \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) outputs points in 3D space, tracing out the curve as \(t\) changes.

#### Defining Arc Length

To find the length of the curve between \(t = a\) and \(t = b\), we start by dividing the interval \([a, b]\) into smaller parts:

- Let \(P = \{t_0, t_1, ..., t_n\}\) be a partition of \([a, b]\), where \(a = t_0 < t_1 < ... < t_n = b\).
- For each subinterval \([t_{k-1}, t_k]\), we look at the straight-line distance between the points \(\mathbf{r}(t_{k-1})\) and \(\mathbf{r}(t_k)\).
- Summing these distances gives an approximation of the curve length:
  \[
  s(\mathbf{r}, P) = \sum_{k=1}^n \|\mathbf{r}(t_k) - \mathbf{r}(t_{k-1})\|
  \]
- The **arc length** \(s(\mathbf{r})\) is the supremum (the least upper bound) of these sums over all possible partitions \(P\):
  \[
  s(\mathbf{r}) = \sup \{ s(\mathbf{r}, P) \mid P \text{ is a partition of } [a,b] \}
  \]

If this supremum is a finite real number, the curve is called **rectifiable**.

#### Important Theorem: Arc Length Integral

If the curve \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) is continuously differentiable (denoted \(\mathbf{r} \in C^1\)), then the curve is rectifiable, and the arc length can be computed exactly by an integral:
\[
s(\mathbf{r}) = \int_a^b \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| \, dt
\]
Here, \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\) is the derivative of \(\mathbf{r}(t)\), representing the velocity vector along the curve, and \(\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|\) is its magnitude (speed).

#### Note on Mean Value Theorem (MVT)

The usual Mean Value Theorem from calculus does **not** apply directly to vector-valued functions in the same way. However, in two dimensions (\(\mathbb{R}^2\)), there exists some \(c \in (a,b)\) such that the derivative \(\mathbf{r}'(c)\) is parallel to the vector \(\mathbf{r}(b) - \mathbf{r}(a)\).

#### Changing the Parameter of a Curve

Sometimes, we want to reparametrize the curve, meaning we change the parameter \(t\) to a new parameter \(\tau\) via a function \(t = g(\tau)\). This produces a new vector function \(\mathbf{r}(g(\tau))\) that traces the same curve but possibly at a different speed or direction.

The **Chain Rule** applies here: if \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) and \(g(\tau)\) are differentiable, then \(\mathbf{r}(g(\tau))\) is differentiable with respect to \(\tau\), and its derivative is:
\[
\frac{d}{d\tau} \mathbf{r}(g(\tau)) = \mathbf{r}'(g(\tau)) \cdot g'(\tau)
\]

#### Arc Length Parameterization

A special and very useful parameterization of a curve is the **arc length parameterization**. Instead of using an arbitrary parameter \(t\), we use the arc length \(s\) itself as the parameter.

Given a reference point \(\mathbf{r}(t_0)\) on the curve, the arc length from this point to \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) is:
\[
s = \int_{t_0}^t \|\mathbf{r}'(u)\| \, du
\]
This means \(s\) measures the distance traveled along the curve starting from \(t_0\).

#### Key Properties of Arc Length Parameterization

- When the curve is parameterized by arc length \(s\), the magnitude of the velocity vector is always 1:
  \[
  \left\|\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{ds}\right\| = 1
  \]
- This means the curve is traced at a constant speed of 1 unit per unit of \(s\).
- If the original parameter \(t\) already satisfies \(\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = 1\), then \(t\) itself is an arc length parameter (up to a shift).



### 2. üß≠ Unit Tangent, Normal, and Binormal Vectors: Understanding Direction and Orientation of Curves

To understand how a curve behaves in space, we look at vectors that describe its direction and how it bends or twists.

#### Unit Tangent Vector \(\mathbf{T}(t)\)

The **unit tangent vector** points in the direction the curve is moving at each point. It is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{T}(t) = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(t)}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|}
\]
- This vector has length 1.
- It points in the direction of increasing parameter \(t\).
- Intuitively, \(\mathbf{T}(t)\) tells us the direction of motion along the curve.

#### Principal Unit Normal Vector \(\mathbf{N}(t)\)

The curve can change direction as it moves, and the **principal normal vector** points toward the direction in which the curve is turning.

- It is defined as the normalized derivative of the unit tangent vector:
  \[
  \mathbf{N}(t) = \frac{\mathbf{T}'(t)}{\|\mathbf{T}'(t)\|}
  \]
- \(\mathbf{N}(t)\) is perpendicular to \(\mathbf{T}(t)\).
- On a plane, \(\mathbf{N}(t)\) points toward the concave side of the curve, indicating the direction of the curve‚Äôs bending.

#### Binormal Vector \(\mathbf{B}(t)\)

In three dimensions, the curve can twist out of the plane formed by \(\mathbf{T}(t)\) and \(\mathbf{N}(t)\). The **binormal vector** completes the right-handed coordinate system and is defined by the cross product:
\[
\mathbf{B}(t) = \mathbf{T}(t) \times \mathbf{N}(t)
\]
- \(\mathbf{B}(t)\) is perpendicular to both \(\mathbf{T}(t)\) and \(\mathbf{N}(t)\).
- It has length 1.
- The set \(\{\mathbf{T}(t), \mathbf{N}(t), \mathbf{B}(t)\}\) forms an orthonormal basis called the **TNB frame** or **Frenet-Serret frame**.
- This frame moves along the curve and describes its local geometric behavior.

#### Geometric Planes Defined by TNB Vectors

At each point on the curve, the TNB vectors define three mutually perpendicular planes:

- **Rectifying plane (TB-plane):** spanned by \(\mathbf{T}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\).
- **Osculating plane (TN-plane):** spanned by \(\mathbf{T}\) and \(\mathbf{N}\). This plane best approximates the curve near the point.
- **Normal plane (NB-plane):** spanned by \(\mathbf{N}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\).

#### Alternative Expression for Binormal Vector

The binormal vector can also be expressed directly in terms of the derivatives of \(\mathbf{r}(t)\):
\[
\mathbf{B}(t) = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)\|}
\]
When the curve is parameterized by arc length \(s\), this simplifies to:
\[
\mathbf{B}(s) = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(s) \times \mathbf{r}''(s)}{\|\mathbf{r}''(s)\|}
\]



### 3. üîÑ Curvature: How Much a Curve Bends

Curvature measures how sharply a curve bends at a given point. A straight line has zero curvature, while a circle has constant curvature equal to the reciprocal of its radius.

#### Definition of Curvature \(\kappa\)

For a curve parameterized by arc length \(s\), the curvature \(\kappa(s)\) is defined as the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to \(s\):
\[
\kappa(s) = \left\|\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds}\right\| = \|\mathbf{r}''(s)\|
\]
- Since \(\mathbf{T}(s)\) is a unit vector, its derivative \(\mathbf{T}'(s)\) points in the direction of the principal normal vector.
- The curvature tells us how quickly the direction of the curve changes as we move along it.

#### Curvature in Terms of a General Parameter \(t\)

If the curve is parameterized by a general parameter \(t\), the curvature can be computed by:
\[
\kappa(t) = \frac{\|\mathbf{T}'(t)\|}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|} = \frac{\|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)\|}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|^3}
\]
- The first formula uses the derivative of the unit tangent vector.
- The second formula uses the cross product of the first and second derivatives of \(\mathbf{r}(t)\).
- Both formulas give the same curvature value.

#### Example: Curvature of a Helix

For a helix defined by \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t, b t)\), where \(a, b \geq 0\), the curvature depends on \(a\) and \(b\). The exact formula can be derived using the above curvature formulas.

#### Radius of Curvature \(\rho\)

The **radius of curvature** at a point on the curve is the reciprocal of the curvature:
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{\kappa}
\]
- It represents the radius of the **osculating circle**, which is the circle that best approximates the curve near that point.
- The osculating circle shares the same tangent and curvature as the curve at the point.
- The center of this circle lies on the concave side of the curve.



## Summary

- **Arc length** measures the length of a curve and can be computed via an integral if the curve is smooth.
- The **unit tangent vector** \(\mathbf{T}\) points in the direction of motion along the curve.
- The **principal normal vector** \(\mathbf{N}\) points toward the direction the curve is turning.
- The **binormal vector** \(\mathbf{B}\) completes a right-handed coordinate system with \(\mathbf{T}\) and \(\mathbf{N}\), describing the curve‚Äôs orientation in space.
- **Curvature** \(\kappa\) quantifies how sharply the curve bends, and the **radius of curvature** \(\rho\) is the radius of the best-fitting circle at a point.

This framework is fundamental in understanding the geometry and behavior of curves in space, with applications in physics, engineering, and computer graphics.

**Correct answers:** A, B

**Explanation:**  
- B is true in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), where a point exists with \(\mathbf{r}'(c)\) parallel to \(\mathbf{r}(b) - \mathbf{r}(a)\).

**Correct answers:** A, C  
**Explanation:**  
- A is true because constant speed 1 means \(t\) is an arc length parameter.

#### 16. Which of the following expressions correctly define the binormal vector \(\mathbf{B}(t)\) in terms of \(\mathbf{r}(t)\)?

**Correct answers:** A, C  
**Explanation:**  
- A is the formula expressing \(\mathbf{B}(t)\) directly from \(\mathbf{r}'\) and \(\mathbf{r}''\).  
- C is the definition of \(\mathbf{B}(t)\) as the cross product of \(\mathbf{T}\) and \(\mathbf{N}\).

- D is incorrect because \(\mathbf{B}(t)\) is not defined as normalized \(\mathbf{r}''(t)\).



#### 17. The set \(\{\mathbf{T}(t), \mathbf{N}(t), \mathbf{B}(t)\}\) forms:

**Correct answers:** A, C  
**Explanation:**  
- They form a right-handed orthonormal basis (A) and are mutually perpendicular unit vectors (C).  
- B is false because the system is right-handed, not left-handed.  
- D is false because the TNB frame depends on the curve‚Äôs geometry, not parameterization speed.



#### 18. Which of the following statements about the normal vector \(\mathbf{N}(t)\) are correct?

**Correct answers:** A, C, D  
**Explanation:**  
- A is true because \(\mathbf{N}(t)\) is perpendicular to \(\mathbf{T}(t)\).  
- C is true because \(\mathbf{N}(t)\) points in the direction the curve is turning.  
- D is true because \(\mathbf{N}(t)\) is defined only if \(\mathbf{T}'(t) \neq 0\).  
- B is false because \(\mathbf{N}(t)\) is not necessarily in the direction of acceleration \(\mathbf{r}''(t)\).



#### 19. For the helix \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t, b t)\), which of the following affect its curvature?

**Correct answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:**  
- Both \(a\) (radius of circular component) and \(b\) (pitch) affect curvature.  
- \(t\) itself does not affect curvature since the helix has constant curvature.  
- Speed depends on \(a\) and \(b\) but is not a direct parameter.



#### 20. Which of the following are true about the arc length integral?

**Correct answers:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- A is true because \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) must be continuously differentiable to use the integral formula.  
- B is true because the arc length integral is used to reparameterize curves by arc length.  
- D is true because the integral is the limit of sums of chord lengths as partitions get finer.  
- C is false because the arc length is generally greater than or equal to the straight-line distance between endpoints.
