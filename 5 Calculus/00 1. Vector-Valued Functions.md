## 1. Vector-Valued Functions

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized, and clear study note based on your lecture content on **Vector-Valued Functions**. I have expanded explanations, clarified key concepts, and structured the note with numbered main headings and emojis for clarity.



## 1. 📐 Introduction to Vector-Valued Functions

Vector-valued functions are a way to describe curves and paths in space using vectors that depend on a parameter, usually denoted by \( t \). Instead of just having a single output number for each input \( t \), a vector-valued function outputs a vector, which can represent a point in 2D or 3D space.

#### What is a Parametric Equation?

A **parametric equation** expresses a set of quantities as functions of one or more independent variables called **parameters**. This means instead of writing \( y \) directly as a function of \( x \), both \( x \) and \( y \) are expressed in terms of a third variable \( t \).

**Example:** The parabola \( y = x^2 \) can be rewritten parametrically as:
\[
x = t, \quad y = t^2
\]
Here, \( t \) is the parameter that "runs" along the curve.

#### More Examples of Parametric Equations

- **Circle of radius \( r \):**
\[
x = r \cos \theta, \quad y = r \sin \theta
\]
where \( \theta \) is the parameter (angle).

- **Circular Helix in 3D:**
\[
x = a \cos t, \quad y = a \sin t, \quad z = c t
\]
This describes a spiral winding around the \( z \)-axis.

- **Tricuspoid Curve:**
\[
x = 2 \cos t + \cos 2t, \quad y = 2 \sin t - \sin 2t
\]
A more complex curve with cusps.

#### Definition of a Vector-Valued Function

A **vector-valued function** \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) is a function whose output is a vector. For example, in 3D:
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = x(t) \mathbf{i} + y(t) \mathbf{j} + z(t) \mathbf{k}
\]
where \( x(t), y(t), z(t) \) are real-valued functions called the **components** of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \), and \( t \) is the parameter.

**Example:** The circular helix can be written as:
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t, c t)
\]
for \( t \geq 0 \).

#### Domain of Vector-Valued Functions

The **natural domain** of a vector-valued function is the set of all \( t \) values for which all component functions are defined.

**Example:** For
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = (\ln|t-1|, e^t, \sqrt{t})
\]
- \( \ln|t-1| \) requires \( t \neq 1 \),
- \( e^t \) is defined for all real \( t \),
- \( \sqrt{t} \) requires \( t \geq 0 \).

So the domain is \( t > 0 \) and \( t \neq 1 \).



## 2. 🔍 Limits and Continuity of Vector-Valued Functions

Understanding limits and continuity for vector-valued functions is similar to real-valued functions but involves vectors.

#### Limit of a Real-Valued Function (Review)

For a real-valued function \( f(x) \), the limit as \( x \to a \) is \( L \) if for every small positive number \( \epsilon \), there exists a small positive number \( \delta \) such that whenever \( x \) is within \( \delta \) of \( a \) (but not equal to \( a \)), \( f(x) \) is within \( \epsilon \) of \( L \).

#### Limit of a Vector-Valued Function

For a vector-valued function \( \mathbf{r}(t) \), the limit as \( t \to a \) is a vector \( \mathbf{L} \) if for every \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists \( \delta > 0 \) such that whenever \( 0 < |t - a| < \delta \), the distance between \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) and \( \mathbf{L} \) (measured by the norm \( \|\mathbf{r}(t) - \mathbf{L}\| \)) is less than \( \epsilon \).

#### Component-wise Limit Theorem

The limit of a vector-valued function exists if and only if the limits of each of its component functions exist. Formally:
\[
\lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{L} = (L_1, L_2, L_3)
\]
if and only if
\[
\lim_{t \to a} x(t) = L_1, \quad \lim_{t \to a} y(t) = L_2, \quad \lim_{t \to a} z(t) = L_3
\]

This means we can analyze limits of vector functions by studying each component separately, using familiar single-variable calculus techniques.

#### Limit Laws for Vector-Valued Functions

If \( \mathbf{F}(t) \) and \( \mathbf{G}(t) \) are vector-valued functions and \( h(t) \) is a real-valued function, all with limits as \( t \to a \), then:

- The limit of the sum is the sum of the limits:
\[
\lim_{t \to a} [\mathbf{F}(t) + \mathbf{G}(t)] = \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{F}(t) + \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{G}(t)
\]

- The limit of the difference is the difference of the limits:
\[
\lim_{t \to a} [\mathbf{F}(t) - \mathbf{G}(t)] = \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{F}(t) - \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{G}(t)
\]

- The limit of a scalar times a vector is the product of the limits:
\[
\lim_{t \to a} [h(t) \mathbf{F}(t)] = \lim_{t \to a} h(t) \cdot \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{F}(t)
\]

- The limit of the dot product is the dot product of the limits:
\[
\lim_{t \to a} [\mathbf{F}(t) \cdot \mathbf{G}(t)] = \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{F}(t) \cdot \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{G}(t)
\]

- The limit of the cross product is the cross product of the limits:
\[
\lim_{t \to a} [\mathbf{F}(t) \times \mathbf{G}(t)] = \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{F}(t) \times \lim_{t \to a} \mathbf{G}(t)
\]

#### Continuity of Vector-Valued Functions

A vector-valued function \( \mathbf{r} \) is **continuous** at \( t = a \) if:
- \( a \) is in the domain of \( \mathbf{r} \),
- and the limit of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) as \( t \to a \) equals \( \mathbf{r}(a) \).

This means the function has no "jumps" or "holes" at \( t = a \).

Continuity of \( \mathbf{r} \) at \( a \) is equivalent to continuity of each component function at \( a \).



## 3. ✏️ Differentiation of Vector-Valued Functions

Differentiation extends naturally to vector-valued functions by differentiating each component function.

#### Definition of the Derivative

The derivative of a vector-valued function \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) at \( t \) is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{r}'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\mathbf{r}(t+h) - \mathbf{r}(t)}{h}
\]
provided this limit exists.

This derivative \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) is itself a vector-valued function.

#### Component-wise Differentiation

\( \mathbf{r} \) is differentiable at \( t \) if and only if each component function \( x(t), y(t), z(t) \) is differentiable at \( t \). In that case,
\[
\mathbf{r}'(t) = (x'(t), y'(t), z'(t))
\]

#### Rules of Differentiation for Vector-Valued Functions

Let \( \mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2 \) be differentiable vector functions, \( f(t) \) a differentiable scalar function, \( k \) a scalar constant, and \( \mathbf{c} \) a constant vector. Then:

- Derivative of a constant vector is zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}[\mathbf{c}] = \mathbf{0}
\]

- Scalar multiple rule:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}[k \mathbf{r}(t)] = k \mathbf{r}'(t)
\]

- Sum and difference rules:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}[\mathbf{r}_1(t) \pm \mathbf{r}_2(t)] = \mathbf{r}_1'(t) \pm \mathbf{r}_2'(t)
\]

- Product rule for scalar times vector:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}[f(t) \mathbf{r}(t)] = f(t) \mathbf{r}'(t) + f'(t) \mathbf{r}(t)
\]

#### Tangent Vectors and Tangent Lines

If \( \mathbf{r}'(t_0) \) exists and is not the zero vector, then \( \mathbf{r}'(t_0) \) is called a **tangent vector** to the curve at the point \( \mathbf{r}(t_0) \).

The **tangent line** at \( \mathbf{r}(t_0) \) is the line passing through \( \mathbf{r}(t_0) \) in the direction of \( \mathbf{r}'(t_0) \). Its parametric equation is:
\[
\mathbf{L}(s) = \mathbf{r}(t_0) + s \mathbf{r}'(t_0)
\]
where \( s \) is a real parameter.



## 4. 📏 Applications of Derivatives: Angles Between Curves

When two vector-valued functions \( \mathbf{r}_1(t) \) and \( \mathbf{r}_2(t) \) intersect at a point, we can find the angle between their tangent lines at that point.

- The tangent vectors at the point are \( \mathbf{r}_1'(t_0) \) and \( \mathbf{r}_2'(t_0) \).
- The angle \( \theta \) between the tangent lines is the angle between these vectors.
- Use the dot product formula:
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{r}_1'(t_0) \cdot \mathbf{r}_2'(t_0)}{\|\mathbf{r}_1'(t_0)\| \|\mathbf{r}_2'(t_0)\|}
\]
- Then find \( \theta \) by taking the inverse cosine.



## 5. 🔄 Differentiation of Dot and Cross Products

For differentiable vector functions \( \mathbf{r}_1(t) \) and \( \mathbf{r}_2(t) \):

- Derivative of the dot product:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}[\mathbf{r}_1(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}_2(t)] = \mathbf{r}_1'(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}_2(t) + \mathbf{r}_1(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}_2'(t)
\]

- Derivative of the cross product:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}[\mathbf{r}_1(t) \times \mathbf{r}_2(t)] = \mathbf{r}_1'(t) \times \mathbf{r}_2(t) + \mathbf{r}_1(t) \times \mathbf{r}_2'(t)
\]

These rules are vector analogues of the product rule in single-variable calculus.



## 6. ⊥ Orthogonality of Vector and Its Derivative

If the magnitude (length) of a vector-valued function \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) is constant for all \( t \), then the vector \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) is always **perpendicular** (orthogonal) to its derivative \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \).

Formally:
\[
\|\mathbf{r}(t)\| = \text{constant} \implies \mathbf{r}(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) = 0 \quad \forall t
\]

This means the vector \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) moves along a path where its length does not change, and the direction of change is always perpendicular to the vector itself.



## 7. ∫ Integration of Vector-Valued Functions

Integration of vector-valued functions is done component-wise, just like differentiation.

If
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = x(t) \mathbf{i} + y(t) \mathbf{j} + z(t) \mathbf{k}
\]
is continuous on \( [a, b] \), then the definite integral is:
\[
\int_a^b \mathbf{r}(t) \, dt = \left( \int_a^b x(t) \, dt \right) \mathbf{i} + \left( \int_a^b y(t) \, dt \right) \mathbf{j} + \left( \int_a^b z(t) \, dt \right) \mathbf{k}
\]

#### Integration Rules

For vector-valued functions \( \mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2 \) continuous on \( [a,b] \), and scalar \( k \):

- Scalar multiple:
\[
\int_a^b k \mathbf{r}(t) \, dt = k \int_a^b \mathbf{r}(t) \, dt
\]

- Sum and difference:
\[
\int_a^b [\mathbf{r}_1(t) \pm \mathbf{r}_2(t)] \, dt = \int_a^b \mathbf{r}_1(t) \, dt \pm \int_a^b \mathbf{r}_2(t) \, dt
\]



## 8. ✅ Summary of Key Concepts

- **Vector-valued functions** describe curves in space using vectors depending on a parameter.
- Limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration of vector functions are done **component-wise**.
- Tangent vectors and tangent lines describe the direction of the curve at a point.
- Differentiation rules extend naturally to sums, scalar multiples, dot products, and cross products.
- If the length of a vector function is constant, the vector and its derivative are orthogonal.
- Integration of vector functions is performed by integrating each component separately.

## Answers

Certainly! Below are the correct answers for each question along with brief explanations.



#### 1. Which of the following are examples of parametric equations?  
**Correct:** A, C, D  
**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**  
- A) Components are scalar functions.  
- B) \( t \) is the parameter.

#### 3. The natural domain of the vector-valued function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (\ln|t-1|, e^t, \sqrt{t}) \) is:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**

#### 9. The tangent vector to the curve defined by \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) at \( t = t_0 \) is:  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- Tangent vector is \( \mathbf{r}'(t_0) \) if nonzero.  
- \( \mathbf{r}(t_0) \) is position vector, not tangent.  
- Tangent vector is not necessarily perpendicular to position vector.



#### 10. The equation of the tangent line to the curve at \( t = t_0 \) is:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- Tangent line passes through \( \mathbf{r}(t_0) \) in direction \( \mathbf{r}'(t_0) \).  
- Other options mix up points and directions.



#### 11. If two vector-valued functions \( \mathbf{r}_1(t) \) and \( \mathbf{r}_2(t) \) intersect at the origin, the acute angle \( \theta \) between their tangent lines at the origin is given by:  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:**  
- Angle between tangent lines is given by inverse cosine of normalized dot product.  
- C and D are incorrect formulas.



#### 12. The derivative of the dot product \( \mathbf{r}_1(t) \cdot \mathbf{r}_2(t) \) is:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- Product rule for dot product: derivative of first times second plus first times derivative of second.



#### 13. The derivative of the cross product \( \mathbf{r}_1(t) \times \mathbf{r}_2(t) \) is:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- Product rule for cross product is similar to dot product but with cross products.



#### 14. If \( \|\mathbf{r}(t)\| \) is constant for all \( t \), then:  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:**  
- Constant magnitude implies \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) and \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) are orthogonal.  
- C and D are not necessarily true.



#### 15. The definite integral of a vector-valued function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) \) over \( [a,b] \) is:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- Integration is done component-wise, resulting in a vector of integrals.



#### 16. Which of the following integration properties hold for vector-valued functions?  
**Correct:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**  
- Scalar multiplication and sum/difference rules hold.  
- D is false; integral is not sum of endpoint values.



#### 17. Which of the following statements about differentiability and continuity of vector-valued functions is true?  
**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:**  
- Differentiability implies continuity (A).  
- Differentiability requires all components differentiable (C).  
- Continuity does not imply differentiability (B).  
- D is false.



#### 18. If \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (t^2, \sin t, e^t) \), then \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) is:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- Derivative of each component: \( 2t, \cos t, e^t \).



#### 19. Which of the following vector-valued functions represent a curve lying entirely on a sphere of radius \( R \)?  
**Correct:** A, C, D  
**Explanation:**  
- A) Lies on circle of radius \( R \) in xy-plane.  
- C) \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2 \) since \( z = R \cos t \) also bounded.  
- D) Similarly, \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2 \).  
- B) Has \( z = R t \), unbounded, so not on sphere.



#### 20. Which of the following statements about the tangent vector \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) is false?  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- Tangent vector is velocity direction (A), can be zero (C), and defines tangent line (D).  
- It is **not always perpendicular** to \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) (B is false).
