## Study Notes: Arc Length, Space Curves, and Curvature



### 1. 📏 Arc Length: Understanding the Length of a Curve

When we talk about the length of a curve in three-dimensional space (ℝ³), we want to measure how long the curve is from one point to another along its path. This is called the **arc length**.

#### What is a Curve in ℝ³?

A curve can be represented by a vector-valued function:

\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))
\]

where \( t \) is a parameter varying over an interval \([a, b]\).

#### How Do We Define Arc Length?

To find the length of the curve between \( t = a \) and \( t = b \), we use the idea of approximating the curve by a series of straight line segments connecting points on the curve.

- We choose a **partition** \( P = \{t_0, t_1, ..., t_n\} \) of the interval \([a, b]\), where \( a = t_0 < t_1 < ... < t_n = b \).
- For each subinterval, we calculate the distance between points on the curve:

\[
\|\mathbf{r}(t_k) - \mathbf{r}(t_{k-1})\|
\]

- Summing these distances gives an approximation of the curve length:

\[
s(\mathbf{r}, P) = \sum_{k=1}^n \|\mathbf{r}(t_k) - \mathbf{r}(t_{k-1})\|
\]

- The **arc length** \( s(\mathbf{r}) \) is the supremum (the least upper bound) of all such sums over all possible partitions \( P \):

\[
s(\mathbf{r}) = \sup \{ s(\mathbf{r}, P) \mid P \in \mathcal{P}[a,b] \}
\]

If this supremum is a finite real number, the curve is called **rectifiable**.

#### Important Theorem: Arc Length for Smooth Curves

If the curve \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) is continuously differentiable (denoted \( \mathbf{r} \in C^1 \)) on \([a,b]\), then the curve is rectifiable, and the arc length can be computed exactly by the integral:

\[
s(\mathbf{r}) = \int_a^b \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| \, dt
\]

Here, \( \mathbf{r}'(t) \) is the derivative of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \), representing the velocity vector along the curve, and its norm \( \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| \) gives the speed at which the curve is traced.

#### Note on Mean Value Theorem (MVT)

The classical Mean Value Theorem does not apply directly to vector-valued functions in the same way it does for real-valued functions. However, in two dimensions, there exists some \( c \in (a,b) \) such that the derivative \( \mathbf{r}'(c) \) is parallel to the vector \( \mathbf{r}(b) - \mathbf{r}(a) \).

#### Changing the Parameter of a Curve

Sometimes, we want to reparameterize the curve, meaning we change the variable \( t \) to another parameter \( \tau \) via a function \( t = g(\tau) \). This produces a new vector function:

\[
\mathbf{r}(g(\tau))
\]

which traces the same curve but possibly at a different speed or direction as \( \tau \) increases.

The **Chain Rule** applies here: if \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) and \( g(\tau) \) are differentiable, then

\[
\frac{d}{d\tau} \mathbf{r}(g(\tau)) = \mathbf{r}'(g(\tau)) \cdot g'(\tau)
\]

#### Arc Length Parameterization

A special and very useful parameterization of a curve is the **arc length parameterization**. Instead of using an arbitrary parameter \( t \), we use the arc length \( s \) itself as the parameter.

Given a reference point \( \mathbf{r}(t_0) \), the arc length from \( t_0 \) to \( t \) is:

\[
s = \int_{t_0}^t \|\mathbf{r}'(u)\| \, du
\]

This parameter \( s \) measures the distance traveled along the curve from the reference point.



### 2. 🧭 Unit Tangent, Normal, and Binormal Vectors: The Moving Frame Along a Curve

To understand how a curve behaves in space, we look at vectors that describe its direction and how it bends.

#### Unit Tangent Vector \( \mathbf{T}(t) \)

The **unit tangent vector** points in the direction the curve is moving at each point. It is defined as:

\[
\mathbf{T}(t) = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(t)}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|}
\]

This vector has length 1 and points along the curve in the direction of increasing \( t \).

#### Principal Unit Normal Vector \( \mathbf{N}(t) \)

The curve may be turning or bending, and the direction of this turning is given by the **principal unit normal vector**:

\[
\mathbf{N}(t) = \frac{\mathbf{T}'(t)}{\|\mathbf{T}'(t)\|}
\]

This vector is perpendicular to \( \mathbf{T}(t) \) and points toward the center of curvature — the direction in which the curve is "turning."

- Intuitively, if you imagine a car moving along the curve, \( \mathbf{T} \) points forward, and \( \mathbf{N} \) points toward the inside of the turn.

#### Binormal Vector \( \mathbf{B}(t) \)

In three dimensions, the curve can twist out of the plane formed by \( \mathbf{T} \) and \( \mathbf{N} \). The **binormal vector** completes the right-handed coordinate system:

\[
\mathbf{B}(t) = \mathbf{T}(t) \times \mathbf{N}(t)
\]

- \( \mathbf{B}(t) \) is perpendicular to both \( \mathbf{T}(t) \) and \( \mathbf{N}(t) \).
- The set \( \{\mathbf{T}(t), \mathbf{N}(t), \mathbf{B}(t)\} \) forms the **TNB frame**, a moving coordinate system along the curve.
- This frame helps describe the curve’s geometry fully: direction, bending, and twisting.

#### Geometric Planes Defined by TNB Vectors

At each point on the curve, the TNB vectors define three important planes:

- **Osculating Plane (TN-plane):** Contains \( \mathbf{T} \) and \( \mathbf{N} \), the plane of the curve’s immediate bending.
- **Rectifying Plane (TB-plane):** Contains \( \mathbf{T} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \).
- **Normal Plane (NB-plane):** Contains \( \mathbf{N} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \).

These planes help analyze the curve’s local behavior.



### 3. 🔄 Curvature: Measuring How a Curve Bends

Curvature quantifies how sharply a curve bends at a given point.

#### Definition of Curvature \( \kappa \)

If the curve is parameterized by arc length \( s \), the curvature at \( s \) is:

\[
\kappa(s) = \left\| \frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds} \right\| = \|\mathbf{r}''(s)\|
\]

- Here, \( \mathbf{r}''(s) \) is the second derivative of the position vector with respect to arc length.
- Intuitively, curvature measures the rate of change of the tangent vector as you move along the curve.
- A straight line has zero curvature because the tangent vector does not change direction.
- A circle of radius \( R \) has constant curvature \( \kappa = \frac{1}{R} \).

#### Curvature in Terms of a General Parameter \( t \)

If the curve is parameterized by \( t \) (not necessarily arc length), curvature can be computed by:

\[
\kappa(t) = \frac{\|\mathbf{T}'(t)\|}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|} = \frac{\|\mathbf{r}'(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)\|}{\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|^3}
\]

- The first formula uses the rate of change of the unit tangent vector.
- The second formula uses the cross product of the first and second derivatives of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \).
- Both formulas give the same curvature value.

#### Radius of Curvature and Osculating Circle

The **radius of curvature** \( \rho \) at a point is the reciprocal of curvature:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{\kappa}
\]

- The **osculating circle** at a point on the curve is the circle that best approximates the curve near that point.
- It has radius \( \rho \) and lies on the concave side of the curve.
- The center of this circle is called the **center of curvature**.



### 4. 🌀 Examples and Applications

#### Example: Helix Parameterized by Arc Length

Given a helix:

\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = (\sin t, \cos t, 2t)
\]

- To express this in terms of arc length \( s \), we compute the speed:

\[
\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{\cos^2 t + (-\sin t)^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5}
\]

- The arc length from \( t=0 \) is:

\[
s = \int_0^t \sqrt{5} \, du = \sqrt{5} t
\]

- So, \( t = \frac{s}{\sqrt{5}} \), and the helix in terms of \( s \) is:

\[
\mathbf{r}(s) = \left(\sin \frac{s}{\sqrt{5}}, \cos \frac{s}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2s}{\sqrt{5}}\right)
\]

#### Example: Curvature of a Helix

For the helix \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t, b t) \), the curvature is:

\[
\kappa = \frac{a}{a^2 + b^2}
\]

This shows how the parameters \( a \) and \( b \) affect the bending of the helix.



## Summary

- **Arc length** measures the length of a curve and can be computed via an integral if the curve is smooth.
- The **unit tangent vector** points along the curve’s direction, the **principal normal vector** points toward the curve’s turning direction, and the **binormal vector** completes a right-handed coordinate system.
- The **curvature** quantifies how sharply the curve bends and is related to the rate of change of the tangent vector.
- The **radius of curvature** is the radius of the best-fitting circle at a point on the curve.
- These concepts together help us understand the geometry and behavior of curves in space.

- Osculating circle is not defined in the usual sense (C is false because it can be considered a circle of infinite radius).  
- \( \mathbf{N}(t) \) is not zero but undefined or arbitrary since curvature is zero (D false).



#### 19. The radius of curvature \( \rho \) at a point on a curve is:

**Correct answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**  
- It is the radius of the osculating circle (A).  
- It equals \( 1/\kappa \) (B).  
- It is positive if curvature is non-zero (C).  
- D is false; radius of curvature is not the distance from origin.



#### 20. Which of the following statements about the TNB frame are true?

**Correct answers:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- The TNB vectors form a right-handed orthonormal basis (A).  
- The frame moves along the curve as \( t \) changes (B).  
- The binormal vector is perpendicular to the curve, not tangent (C false).  
- The TNB frame defines three mutually perpendicular planes at each point (D).
