Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized, and clear study note based on the lecture content on **Residue Theory**. I have expanded explanations, clarified key concepts, and structured the note for easy understanding. Emojis and numbering are used for clarity and navigation.



## 1. 🧩 Introduction to Residue Theory and Singularities

Residue theory is a powerful tool in complex analysis that helps us evaluate complex integrals, especially those involving functions with singularities. To understand residue theory, we first need to understand what singularities are and how they are classified.

#### What is a singularity?

A **singular point** (or singularity) of a complex function \( f(z) \) is a point \( \alpha \) where the function is **not analytic** (not differentiable in the complex sense), but in every neighborhood around \( \alpha \), there are points where \( f \) *is* analytic. This means the function misbehaves only at \( \alpha \), but behaves nicely nearby.

#### Isolated singularities

An **isolated singularity** is a singularity \( \alpha \) such that there exists a small radius \( R > 0 \) where \( f \) is analytic everywhere in the punctured disk around \( \alpha \), denoted \( D_R^*(\alpha) = \{ z : 0 < |z - \alpha| < R \} \). This means \( \alpha \) is the only singularity in that small neighborhood.

**Example:**  
Consider \( f(z) = \frac{1}{1-z} \). At \( z=1 \), \( f \) is not analytic (division by zero), but everywhere else it is analytic. So, \( z=1 \) is an isolated singularity.



## 2. 🔍 Classification of Isolated Singularities

Once we identify an isolated singularity \( \alpha \), we classify it by looking at the **Laurent series** expansion of \( f \) around \( \alpha \):

\[
f(z) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k (z - \alpha)^k
\]

valid for \( 0 < |z - \alpha| < R \).

#### Types of isolated singularities:

- **Removable singularity:**  
  All coefficients \( a_k = 0 \) for \( k < 0 \). This means the function looks like a Taylor series (no negative powers), so the singularity can be "removed" by redefining \( f(\alpha) \) appropriately.

- **Pole of order \( n \):**  
  There exists a finite negative power \( -n \) such that \( a_{-n} \neq 0 \), and all \( a_k = 0 \) for \( k < -n \). The function behaves like \( \frac{1}{(z-\alpha)^n} \) near \( \alpha \).

- **Essential singularity:**  
  There are infinitely many negative powers with nonzero coefficients \( a_k \neq 0 \) for infinitely many \( k < 0 \). The function behaves very wildly near \( \alpha \).

#### Residue

The **residue** of \( f \) at \( \alpha \), denoted \( \text{Res}[f, \alpha] \), is the coefficient \( a_{-1} \) in the Laurent series. This coefficient plays a crucial role in evaluating integrals around singularities.



## 3. ✨ Examples of Singularities and Residues

- \( f(z) = \frac{\sin z}{z} \) has a **removable singularity** at \( z=0 \) because the singularity can be removed by defining \( f(0) = 1 \).

- \( g(z) = \cos z - 1 \) also has a removable singularity at \( z=0 \).

- \( f(z) = \frac{\sin z}{z^3} \) has a **pole of order 2** at \( z=0 \) because the denominator has \( z^3 \) but the numerator behaves like \( z \) near zero, so the net singularity is like \( \frac{1}{z^2} \).

- \( g(z) = z e^z \) has a **simple pole** (pole of order 1) at \( z=0 \).

- \( f(z) = z^2 \sin z \) has an **essential singularity** (this example is a bit unusual; typically essential singularities arise from functions like \( e^{1/z} \), but here the lecture states it as an example).



## 4. 🧮 Zeros of Analytic Functions

A **zero** of order \( k \) at \( z = \alpha \) means the function \( f \) and its first \( k-1 \) derivatives vanish at \( \alpha \), but the \( k \)-th derivative does not:

\[
f(\alpha) = f'(\alpha) = \cdots = f^{(k-1)}(\alpha) = 0, \quad f^{(k)}(\alpha) \neq 0
\]

- A **simple zero** is a zero of order 1.

#### Taylor series characterization

If \( f \) is analytic at \( \alpha \), then its Taylor series around \( \alpha \) looks like:

\[
f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (z - \alpha)^n
\]

and \( f \) has a zero of order \( k \) if and only if:

\[
c_0 = c_1 = \cdots = c_{k-1} = 0, \quad c_k \neq 0
\]

#### Alternative form

\( f \) can be written as:

\[
f(z) = (z - \alpha)^k g(z)
\]

where \( g \) is analytic at \( \alpha \) and \( g(\alpha) \neq 0 \).

#### Product of zeros

If \( f \) and \( g \) have zeros of orders \( m \) and \( n \) at \( \alpha \), then their product \( h = fg \) has a zero of order \( m + n \) at \( \alpha \).



## 5. ⚠️ Poles and Their Properties

A function \( f \) has a **pole of order \( k \)** at \( \alpha \) if it can be written as:

\[
f(z) = \frac{h(z)}{(z - \alpha)^k}
\]

where \( h \) is analytic at \( \alpha \) and \( h(\alpha) \neq 0 \).

#### Relationship between zeros and poles

- If \( f \) has a zero of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \), then \( g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z)} \) has a pole of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \).

- Conversely, if \( f \) has a pole of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \), then \( g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z)} \) has a removable singularity at \( \alpha \), and redefining \( g(\alpha) = 0 \) makes \( g \) have a zero of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \).

#### Poles of products and quotients

- If \( f \) and \( g \) have poles of orders \( m \) and \( n \) at \( \alpha \), then \( h = fg \) has a pole of order \( m + n \).

- For the quotient \( h = \frac{f}{g} \), where \( f \) and \( g \) have zeros of orders \( m \) and \( n \) at \( \alpha \):

  1. If \( m > n \), \( h \) has a removable singularity at \( \alpha \), and redefining \( h(\alpha) = 0 \) gives a zero of order \( m - n \).
  
  2. If \( m < n \), \( h \) has a pole of order \( n - m \).
  
  3. If \( m = n \), \( h \) has a removable singularity and can be defined to be analytic at \( \alpha \).



## 6. 🧮 Residues and Their Calculation

The **residue** of a function \( f \) at a singularity \( \alpha \) is the coefficient \( a_{-1} \) in the Laurent series expansion of \( f \) around \( \alpha \).

#### Why are residues important?

Residues allow us to evaluate complex integrals around singularities using the **Residue Theorem**.



## 7. 📜 Cauchy's Residue Theorem

This is a fundamental theorem in complex analysis:

- Let \( D \) be a simply connected domain.
- Let \( C \) be a simple closed positively oriented contour inside \( D \).
- Suppose \( f \) is analytic inside and on \( C \), except for isolated singularities \( z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n \) inside \( C \).

Then,

\[
\oint_C f(z) \, dz = 2 \pi i \sum_{k=1}^n \text{Res}[f, z_k]
\]

This means the integral of \( f \) around \( C \) depends only on the sum of residues of \( f \) at the singularities inside \( C \).



## 8. 🧮 Calculating Residues at Poles

If \( \alpha \) is a pole of order \( n \) of \( f \), the residue at \( \alpha \) can be calculated by:

\[
\text{Res}(f, \alpha) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \lim_{z \to \alpha} \frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}} \left[ (z - \alpha)^n f(z) \right]
\]

This formula allows us to find the residue without explicitly finding the full Laurent series.



## 9. 🧪 Examples and Applications

- **Example:** Find the residue of \( f(z) = \pi \cot(\pi z) \) at \( z=0 \).

- **Example:** Evaluate integrals like

\[
\oint_C (z^4 + z^3 - 2z^2) \, dz
\]

where \( C \) is a circle \( |z| = 3 \).

- **Example:** Evaluate integrals like

\[
\oint_C \frac{1}{z^4 + 4} \, dz
\]

where \( C \) is the circle \( |z - 1| = 2 \).

These examples illustrate how residue theory simplifies complex integral calculations by focusing on singularities and their residues.



## Summary

Residue theory is a cornerstone of complex analysis that connects the behavior of functions near singularities to the evaluation of complex integrals. Understanding isolated singularities, their classification (removable, poles, essential), zeros of analytic functions, and how to calculate residues is essential. The Residue Theorem then provides a powerful method to compute integrals by summing residues inside contours.

## Answers

Certainly! Below are the correct answers for each question along with brief explanations.



#### 1. Which of the following statements correctly define an isolated singularity of a complex function \( f \) at \( \alpha \)?  
**Correct:** A, D  
**Explanation:** An isolated singularity is a point \( \alpha \) where \( f \) is not analytic, but \( f \) is analytic everywhere else in some punctured neighborhood around \( \alpha \). So \( f \) is analytic everywhere except at \( \alpha \).



#### 2. The Laurent series expansion of a function \( f \) around an isolated singularity \( \alpha \) contains terms with negative powers of \( (z-\alpha) \). Which of the following singularities correspond to the presence of infinitely many negative powers?  
**Correct:** C  
**Explanation:** Essential singularities have infinitely many negative powers in their Laurent series. Poles have finitely many negative powers, and removable singularities have none.



#### 3. Which of the following functions has a removable singularity at \( z=0 \)?  
**Correct:** A, D  
**Explanation:** \( \frac{\sin z}{z} \) and \( \frac{\cos z - 1}{z^2} \) can be redefined at zero to remove the singularity. \( \frac{1}{z^2} \) has a pole, and \( e^{1/z} \) has an essential singularity.



#### 4. If \( f(z) \) has a pole of order 3 at \( z = \alpha \), which of the following must be true about its Laurent series coefficients \( a_k \)?  
**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:** For a pole of order 3, \( a_{-3} \neq 0 \) and all coefficients \( a_k = 0 \) for \( k < -3 \). \( a_{-1} \) may or may not be zero.



#### 5. A function \( f \) has a zero of order \( k \) at \( z = \alpha \). Which of the following statements are true?  
**Correct:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:** By definition, the function and its first \( k-1 \) derivatives vanish at \( \alpha \), but the \( k \)-th derivative does not. The Taylor series coefficients up to \( k-1 \) are zero. However, \( g(\alpha) \neq 0 \) in the factorization \( f(z) = (z-\alpha)^k g(z) \), so D is false.



#### 6. Suppose \( f \) and \( g \) are analytic at \( z = \alpha \) with zeros of order \( m \) and \( n \) respectively. What is the order of the zero of \( h(z) = f(z)g(z) \) at \( \alpha \)?  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:** The order of the zero of the product is the sum of the orders of zeros of the factors.



#### 7. If \( f \) has a pole of order \( k \) at \( z = \alpha \), which of the following describes the behavior of \( g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z)} \) at \( \alpha \)?  
**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:** The reciprocal of a function with a pole of order \( k \) has a zero of order \( k \) at \( \alpha \). It also means \( g \) has a removable singularity at \( \alpha \) because it can be redefined to be analytic there.



#### 8. Let \( f \) and \( g \) have poles of orders \( m \) and \( n \) at \( z = \alpha \). What is the order of the pole of \( h(z) = f(z)g(z) \) at \( \alpha \)?  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:** The order of the pole of the product is the sum of the orders of the poles.



#### 9. For the quotient \( h(z) = \frac{f(z)}{g(z)} \), where \( f \) and \( g \) have zeros of orders \( m \) and \( n \) at \( z = \alpha \), which of the following is true?  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** If \( m > n \), the quotient has a removable singularity; if \( m < n \), it has a pole of order \( n - m \); if \( m = n \), it can be defined to be analytic. C is false because equal zeros do not produce a pole.



#### 10. The residue of a function \( f \) at an isolated singularity \( \alpha \) is defined as:  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:** The residue is the coefficient \( a_{-1} \) in the Laurent series expansion.



#### 11. According to Cauchy's Residue Theorem, the integral of \( f \) around a closed contour \( C \) enclosing singularities \( z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n \) is:  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:** The integral is zero if \( f \) is analytic inside \( C \) (no singularities). Otherwise, it equals \( 2\pi i \) times the sum of residues inside \( C \).



#### 12. If \( f \) has a removable singularity at \( z_0 \), what is the residue \( \text{Res}[f, z_0] \)?  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:** Residue at a removable singularity is zero because there are no negative powers in the Laurent expansion.



#### 13. Which of the following formulas correctly gives the residue of \( f \) at a pole of order \( n \) at \( z = \alpha \)?  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:** This is the standard formula for residues at poles of order \( n \).



#### 14. Which of the following functions has an essential singularity at \( z=0 \)?  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:** \( e^{1/z} \) has an essential singularity at zero. The others have poles or removable singularities.



#### 15. If \( f(z) = z \sin z^2 \), what is the order of the zero of \( f \) at \( z=0 \)?  
**Correct:** C  
**Explanation:** \( \sin z^2 \) behaves like \( z^2 \) near zero, so \( f(z) \approx z \cdot z^2 = z^3 \), a zero of order 3.



#### 16. Which of the following statements about poles and zeros is false?  
**Correct:** D  
**Explanation:** The reciprocal of a function with a zero of order \( k \) has a pole of order \( k \), not a removable singularity.



#### 17. Consider the function \( h(z) = \tan z / z \). Which of the following statements about its singularities at \( z=0 \) is true?  
**Correct:** C  
**Explanation:** \( \tan z \approx z + \frac{z^3}{3} + \cdots \), so \( \tan z / z \approx 1 + \frac{z^2}{3} + \cdots \), which is analytic at zero. The singularity at zero is removable.



#### 18. The function \( g(z) = 5z^4 + 26z^2 + 5 \) has poles at:  
**Correct:** D  
**Explanation:** Polynomials have no poles; poles occur where denominators vanish.



#### 19. Which of the following integrals can be evaluated using the Residue Theorem?  
**Correct:** A, C, D  
**Explanation:** The Residue Theorem applies to contour integrals of functions with isolated singularities inside the contour. \( \int_0^1 \sin x dx \) is a real integral, not a contour integral.



#### 20. Which of the following is true about the residue of \( f(z) = e^z \) at \( z=0 \)?  
**Correct:** B, D  
**Explanation:** \( e^z \) is entire (analytic everywhere), so it has no singularities and residue zero at any point.
