## 6. Green‚Äôs Theorem and Surface Integrals

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on your lecture content on **Green‚Äôs Theorem and Surface Integrals**. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step. I‚Äôve added emojis to main headings for clarity and structured the note logically.



### 1. üü¢ Green‚Äôs Theorem: Connecting Line Integrals and Double Integrals

Green‚Äôs Theorem is a fundamental result in vector calculus that creates a powerful link between a line integral around a closed curve and a double integral over the region enclosed by that curve. It essentially allows us to convert a complicated line integral into a (sometimes simpler) double integral, or vice versa.

#### What is Green‚Äôs Theorem?

Suppose you have a region \( D \) in the plane that is **simply connected** (meaning it has no holes) and is bounded by a closed, piecewise smooth curve \( C \). The curve \( C \) is oriented positively, which means it is traversed counterclockwise so that the region \( D \) is always on the left as you move along \( C \).

If \( M(x,y) \) and \( N(x,y) \) are functions with continuous partial derivatives on an open set containing \( D \) and its boundary \( C \), then Green‚Äôs Theorem states:

\[
\oint_C (M\,dx + N\,dy) = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right) dA
\]

- The left side is a **line integral** around the curve \( C \).
- The right side is a **double integral** over the area \( D \).

This theorem essentially says that the circulation of the vector field \( \mathbf{F} = M\mathbf{i} + N\mathbf{j} \) around the boundary \( C \) equals the total "curl" (or rotation) of the field inside \( D \).

#### Why is this useful?

- It simplifies calculations: sometimes the double integral is easier to evaluate than the line integral.
- It provides insight into the relationship between local properties (curl inside the region) and global properties (circulation around the boundary).

#### Examples from the lecture:

- **Example 1:** Verifying Green‚Äôs theorem for the line integral \(\int (-y\,dx + x\,dy)\) over a semicircular path.
- **Example 2:** Calculating work done by a force field \( \mathbf{F}(x,y) = (x + xy^2)\mathbf{i} + 2(x^2 y - y^2 \sin y)\mathbf{j} \) along a closed path \( C \).
- **Example 3:** Using Green‚Äôs theorem to find the area of an ellipse \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \), showing it equals \( \pi ab \).



### 2. üîÑ Green‚Äôs Theorem for Regions with Holes (Multiply Connected Regions)

Green‚Äôs Theorem can be extended to regions that are **doubly connected** or have multiple holes. Imagine a region \( R \) with an outer boundary \( C_1 \) (oriented counterclockwise) and one or more inner boundaries \( C_2, C_3, \ldots \) (holes), each oriented clockwise.

The theorem then states:

\[
\iint_R \left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right) dA = \oint_{C_1} (M\,dx + N\,dy) + \oint_{C_2} (M\,dx + N\,dy) + \cdots
\]

- The integral around the outer boundary is positive (counterclockwise).
- The integrals around the holes are negative (clockwise).

This generalization accounts for the "holes" by subtracting the circulation around them.

#### Example:

- **Example 4:** Evaluate the integral \(\oint_C \frac{-y\,dx + x\,dy}{x^2 + y^2}\) where \( C \) is a closed curve:
  - (a) When \( C \) does **not** enclose the origin.
  - (b) When \( C \) **does** enclose the origin.

This example highlights how the presence of a singularity (the origin) inside the curve affects the integral.



### 3. üåê Surface Integrals: Extending Integration to Surfaces in 3D

Surface integrals generalize the idea of integration to functions defined on surfaces in three-dimensional space. Instead of integrating over an interval or a plane region, we integrate over a curved surface.

#### What is a surface integral?

Given a surface \( \sigma \) in 3D and a scalar function \( f(x,y,z) \) defined on it, the surface integral sums up the values of \( f \) weighted by small surface elements \( dS \):

\[
\iint_\sigma f(x,y,z) \, dS
\]

This integral measures the "total amount" of \( f \) spread over the surface.

#### How do we find the surface element \( dS \)?

To compute surface integrals, we need to understand the surface‚Äôs geometry, especially its **normal vector**.



### 4. üìê Normal Vectors to Surfaces: Understanding Orientation and Area Elements

A **normal vector** to a surface at a point is a vector perpendicular to the surface at that point. It is crucial for defining surface integrals and flux.

#### How to find a normal vector?

- **Parametric surfaces:** If the surface is given by a parametric vector function

\[
\mathbf{r}(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v))
\]

then the normal vector is the cross product of the partial derivatives:

\[
\mathbf{N} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v}
\]

This vector is perpendicular to the surface at each point.

- **Implicit surfaces:** If the surface is defined implicitly by

\[
G(x,y,z) = 0
\]

then the normal vector at a point is the gradient of \( G \):

\[
\mathbf{N} = \nabla G = \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial G}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial G}{\partial z}\right)
\]

- **Graphs of functions:** For surfaces given by \( z = g(x,y) \), an upward-pointing normal vector is

\[
\mathbf{N} = \left(-\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}, -\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}, 1\right)
\]

#### Smooth and piecewise smooth surfaces

- A surface is **smooth** if it has a well-defined, non-zero normal vector at every point.
- It is **piecewise smooth** if it is made up of a finite number of smooth pieces joined together.



### 5. üìä Calculating Surface Integrals: From Parametric to Cartesian Forms

#### Definition of surface integral of a scalar function

To define the surface integral of a continuous function \( f \) over a surface \( \sigma \), we partition \( \sigma \) into small pieces, pick sample points, and sum up \( f \) times the area of each piece. Taking the limit as the pieces get smaller gives the surface integral:

\[
\iint_\sigma f(x,y,z) \, dS = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*, y_k^*, z_k^*) \Delta S_k
\]

provided the limit exists and is independent of the partition or sample points.

#### Surface integral over a parametric surface

If \( \sigma \) is parametrized by \( \mathbf{r}(u,v) \) over a region \( R \) in the \( uv \)-plane, then

\[
\iint_\sigma f(x,y,z) \, dS = \iint_R f(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) \left\| \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v} \right\| du\, dv
\]

This formula converts the surface integral into a double integral over the parameter domain, weighted by the magnitude of the normal vector (which represents the area scaling).

#### Surface integral over a graph \( z = g(x,y) \)

If the surface is given as \( z = g(x,y) \) over a region \( R \) in the \( xy \)-plane, then

\[
\iint_\sigma f(x,y,z) \, dS = \iint_R f(x,y,g(x,y)) \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)^2 + 1} \, dx\, dy
\]

This formula uses the fact that the surface area element \( dS \) relates to the area element \( dx\,dy \) by the factor involving the partial derivatives of \( g \).



### 6. üåä Flux and Oriented Surfaces: Measuring Flow Through Surfaces

#### What is an oriented surface?

An **orientable surface** is one where you can consistently choose a "side" or direction for the normal vector across the entire surface. For example, a sphere is orientable because you can pick the outward normal everywhere.

A **non-orientable surface** (like a M√∂bius strip) has only one side, so you cannot consistently define a normal vector direction.

#### Orientation of parametric surfaces

For a parametric surface \( \mathbf{r}(u,v) \), the positive orientation is given by the unit normal vector

\[
\mathbf{n} = \frac{\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v}}{\left\|\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v}\right\|}
\]

The negative orientation is simply the opposite vector \( -\mathbf{n} \).

#### What is flux?

Flux measures how much of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) "flows" through a surface per unit time. Imagine fluid flowing through a surface: the flux tells you the volume of fluid passing through.

Flux depends on:

1. The speed of the fluid (magnitude of \( \mathbf{F} \)).
2. The angle between the flow and the surface normal (maximum when flow is perpendicular).
3. The area of the surface.

Mathematically, the flux of \( \mathbf{F} \) across a surface \( \sigma \) with unit normal \( \mathbf{n} \) is

\[
\Phi = \iint_\sigma \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

- Positive flux means net flow outwards.
- Negative flux means net flow inwards.
- Zero flux means equal flow in both directions.

#### Calculating flux over parametric surfaces

If \( \mathbf{r}(u,v) \) parametrizes \( \sigma \), then

\[
\Phi = \iint_R \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) \cdot \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v}\right) du\, dv
\]

This formula uses the vector area element \( \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v} \, du\, dv \).



### 7. üßÆ Orientation and Flux for Surfaces Given Implicitly or as Graphs

Surfaces given by equations like \( z = g(x,y) \), \( y = g(z,x) \), or \( x = g(y,z) \) can be treated as level surfaces of functions \( G(x,y,z) = 0 \).

- The gradient \( \nabla G \) is normal to the surface.
- The surface integral for flux can be expressed as

\[
\Phi = \iint_R \mathbf{F} \cdot \frac{\nabla G}{\|\nabla G\|} \, dS
\]

or equivalently, depending on the orientation and projection, as a double integral over the projection region \( R \).

This approach simplifies flux calculations for surfaces defined implicitly or as graphs.



## Summary

- **Green‚Äôs Theorem** connects line integrals around closed curves to double integrals over the enclosed region, simplifying many calculations.
- It extends to multiply connected regions with holes by summing integrals over all boundaries.
- **Surface integrals** generalize integration to curved surfaces in 3D, requiring understanding of normal vectors and surface area elements.
- **Normal vectors** can be found via parametric derivatives, gradients of implicit functions, or partial derivatives of graphs.
- **Flux** measures the flow of a vector field through a surface, depending on the vector field, surface orientation, and area.
- Orientation is crucial for defining flux and surface integrals consistently.
- Surfaces given implicitly or as graphs can be handled using gradients and projections.

#### 1. Which of the following conditions are necessary for Green‚Äôs Theorem to hold on a region \( D \) bounded by curve \( C \)?  
**Correct:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**  
- \( D \) must be simply connected (no holes) for the standard Green‚Äôs Theorem.  
- \( C \) must be positively oriented (counterclockwise) so the interior is on the left.  
- \( M \) and \( N \) must be continuously differentiable on an open set containing \( D \) and \( C \) to ensure the partial derivatives exist and are continuous.  
- D is incorrect because multiply connected regions require a generalized form of Green‚Äôs Theorem.



#### 2. Green‚Äôs Theorem relates the line integral \(\oint_C (M\,dx + N\,dy)\) to which of the following?  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**

#### 3. For a doubly connected region with outer boundary \( C_1 \) and inner boundary \( C_2 \), how are the orientations of these boundaries defined in Green‚Äôs Theorem?  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
The outer boundary \( C_1 \) is oriented counterclockwise (positive orientation), and the inner boundary \( C_2 \) (hole) is oriented clockwise (negative orientation) to maintain consistent orientation of the region.



#### 4. Consider the integral \(\oint_C \frac{-y\,dx + x\,dy}{x^2 + y^2}\) where \( C \) is a simple closed curve. Which statements are true?  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- If \( C \) does not enclose the origin, the integral is zero.  
- If \( C \) encloses the origin once counterclockwise, the integral equals \( 2\pi \).  
- The integral is undefined if \( C \) passes through the origin because the integrand is singular there.  
- The integral depends on whether the origin is enclosed, not on the shape of \( C \).



#### 5. Which of the following expressions correctly gives a normal vector to a parametric surface \( \mathbf{r}(u,v) \)?  
**Correct:** B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- The cross product of the partial derivatives \( \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v} \) gives a normal vector.  
- For implicitly defined surfaces \( G(x,y,z) = 0 \), the gradient \( \nabla G \) is normal to the surface.  
- A is a sum, not a normal vector; C is divergence, not normal vector.



#### 6. For a surface defined implicitly by \( G(x,y,z) = 0 \), which of the following is true about the normal vector at a point on the surface?  
**Correct:** B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- The gradient \( \nabla G \) is normal (perpendicular) to the level surface \( G=0 \).  
- It is not tangent; it points perpendicular to the surface.  
- The gradient is zero only at critical points, not generally on the surface.



#### 7. The surface integral of a scalar function \( f \) over a surface \( \sigma \) is defined as the limit of sums of the form:  
**Correct:** C  
**Explanation:**

#### 8. Which formula correctly expresses the surface integral of \( f \) over a parametric surface \( \mathbf{r}(u,v) \)?  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- The magnitude of the cross product of partial derivatives gives the area scaling factor for the surface element.  
- A is incorrect because it uses addition instead of cross product.  
- C is a dot product, not area.  
- D ignores the surface geometry.



#### 9. For a surface given by \( z = g(x,y) \), the surface element \( dS \) can be expressed as:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- The surface area element includes the square root of \( 1 + g_x^2 + g_y^2 \) to account for the slope of the surface.  
- B misses the constant 1, C ignores slope, D incorrectly sums derivatives.



#### 10. Which of the following surfaces is **non-orientable**?  
**Correct:** C  
**Explanation:**  
- The M√∂bius strip is a classic example of a non-orientable surface with only one side.

#### 11. The flux of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) through a surface \( \sigma \) with unit normal \( \mathbf{n} \) is given by:  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- Flux is the surface integral of the dot product \( \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \) over the surface.  
- A is a cross product, which is not flux.  
- C and D are incomplete or incorrect.



#### 12. Which factors affect the flux of a fluid through a surface?  
**Correct:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**  
- Speed, orientation relative to flow, and surface area all affect flux.  
- Temperature does not directly affect flux in this context.



#### 13. If a parametric surface \( \mathbf{r}(u,v) \) has positive orientation defined by \( \mathbf{n} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v} / \|\cdot\| \), what does the negative orientation correspond to?  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- Negative orientation is the opposite direction of the positive normal vector, i.e., \( -\mathbf{n} \).



#### 14. For the vector field \( \mathbf{F}(x,y,z) = z \mathbf{k} \), what is the flux across the outward oriented sphere \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = a^2 \)?  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- The flux is zero because the vector field points only in the \( z \)-direction and the sphere is symmetric; the net flow cancels out.  
- The integral of \( z \) over a sphere surface is zero due to symmetry.



#### 15. Which of the following statements about the gradient vector \( \nabla G \) of a function \( G(x,y,z) \) is true?  
**Correct:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- The gradient is normal (perpendicular) to the level surface \( G=0 \).  
- It points in the direction of greatest increase, not decrease.  
- It is not zero everywhere on the surface.



#### 16. When evaluating a surface integral over a plane \( 2x - 3y + z = 6 \) above a square region in the \( xy \)-plane, which method is appropriate?  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:**  
- Parametrizing the surface and using the cross product of partial derivatives is standard.  
- Since the surface is a graph \( z = g(x,y) \), the formula for surface integrals over graphs applies.  
- Green‚Äôs Theorem applies to planar regions, not surfaces in 3D.  
- Converting to volume integral is not standard here.



#### 17. Which of the following is true about the area of an ellipse \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \) using Green‚Äôs Theorem?  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- The area of an ellipse is \( \pi ab \), and Green‚Äôs Theorem can be used to prove this by converting the area integral into a line integral.



#### 18. Which of the following integrals represent the work done by a force field \( \mathbf{F} \) along a closed path \( C \)?  
**Correct:** A, C, D  
**Explanation:**  
- Work done is the line integral \( \oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} \), which can be written as \( \oint_C (M\,dx + N\,dy) \).  
- By Green‚Äôs Theorem, this equals the double integral of the curl \( \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} \) over the enclosed region.  
- B is incorrect because the curl is a vector in 3D, and the integral over \( D \) is scalar.



#### 19. Which of the following surfaces can be parametrized using two independent variables?  
**Correct:** D  
**Explanation:**  
- Sphere, cone, and plane are all 2D surfaces in 3D space and can be parametrized by two parameters.



#### 20. If a surface \( \sigma \) is given by \( z = g(x,y) \), and \( \mathbf{F} \) is a vector field, which of the following expresses the flux integral \( \iint_\sigma \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS \) correctly?  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- A uses the vector \( (-g_x, -g_y, 1) \) which is proportional to the normal vector and includes the surface element factor.  
- B expresses the flux using the gradient \( \nabla G \) where \( G = z - g(x,y) \), which is normal to the surface.  
- D is a general statement that the flux is the integral of \( \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS \).  
- C is incorrect because \( (0,0,1) \) is not generally normal to the surface unless the surface is flat and horizontal.
