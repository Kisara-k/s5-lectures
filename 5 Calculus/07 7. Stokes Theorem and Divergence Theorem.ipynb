       "\n",
       "Stokes' Theorem is a fundamental result in vector calculus that connects the circulation of a vector field around a closed curve to the curl of the vector field over the surface bounded by that curve. This theorem generalizes Green's Theorem from the plane to surfaces in three-dimensional space.\n",

       "\n",
       "Imagine you have a smooth surface, like a curved sheet, which is bounded by a closed loop (a curve that starts and ends at the same point without crossing itself). Stokes' Theorem tells us that the total \"circulation\" of a vector field along this boundary curve is equal to the total \"curl\" of the vector field passing through the surface.\n",

       "- Let **œÉ** be a piecewise smooth, oriented surface.\n",
       "- Let **C** be the simple, closed, piecewise smooth curve that forms the boundary of **œÉ**.\n",
       "- Let **F** be a vector field with components $ f(x,y,z), g(x,y,z), h(x,y,z) $ that are continuous and have continuous first partial derivatives on an open set containing **œÉ**.\n",

The curl of **F** at a point measures the tendency of the fluid to rotate or swirl around that point.
