## Study Notes: Analytic Functions, Cauchy-Riemann Equations, and Harmonic Functions



### 1. ðŸ§® Analytic Functions: What They Are and Examples

In complex analysis, an **analytic function** is a function that is differentiable at every point in some domain of the complex plane. Differentiability here means the complex derivative exists and is the same regardless of the direction from which you approach the point.

#### Key Examples:
- **Example 1:** The function \( f(z) = \frac{1}{z} \) is analytic everywhere except at \( z = 0 \), where it is undefined.
- **Example 2:** The function \( f(z) = |z|^2 \) (the square of the modulus of \( z \)) is **not analytic anywhere** except possibly at \( z=0 \), but even there, it does not have a derivative in any neighborhood. This is because the modulus function depends on both \( z \) and its conjugate \( \overline{z} \), breaking complex differentiability.

#### Entire Functions
- **Definition:** An **entire function** is analytic at every finite point in the complex plane.
- **Example:** Every polynomial function is entire because polynomials are differentiable everywhere in the complex plane.

#### Singular Points (Singularities)
- A **singular point** is a point \( a \) where a function \( f \) fails to be analytic, but \( f \) is analytic at points arbitrarily close to \( a \).
- **Types of Singularities:**
  - **Isolated Singular Point:** There exists a small radius \( \delta \) such that \( f \) is analytic everywhere in the punctured disk \( 0 < |z - a| < \delta \), but not at \( a \) itself.
  - **Non-Isolated Singular Points:** Singular points that cluster or form a continuum, not isolated.
    - **Branch Cuts:** These are lines or curves where the function is discontinuous or multi-valued, e.g., the argument function \( \arg(z) \), logarithm \( \log(z) \), and square root \( \sqrt{z} \) often have branch cuts along the negative real axis.
    - **Other Examples:** The function \( \tan(z) \) has singularities at points where cosine is zero, such as \( z = \frac{\pi}{2} \), but these are isolated poles.

#### Important Properties of Analytic Functions:
- The sum, product, and quotient (where denominator is non-zero) of analytic functions are analytic.
- The composition of analytic functions is analytic.
- If the derivative of a function is zero everywhere in a domain, the function must be constant in that domain.



### 2. ðŸ§© Cauchy-Riemann (C-R) Equations and Harmonic Functions

#### What Are C-R Equations?
The Cauchy-Riemann equations are a set of two partial differential equations that provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a complex function \( f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \) to be analytic. Here, \( u \) and \( v \) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \( f \).

The equations are:
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
\]

If these hold and \( u, v \) have continuous first partial derivatives, then \( f \) is analytic.

#### Harmonic Functions
- A **harmonic function** is a twice continuously differentiable real-valued function \( H(x,y) \) that satisfies **Laplaceâ€™s equation**:
\[
H_{xx} + H_{yy} = 0
\]
where \( H_{xx} \) and \( H_{yy} \) are the second partial derivatives with respect to \( x \) and \( y \).

- **Example:** \( T(x,y) = e^{-y} \sin x \) is harmonic because it satisfies Laplaceâ€™s equation everywhere.

#### Connection Between Analytic and Harmonic Functions
- If \( f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \) is analytic, then both \( u \) and \( v \) are harmonic functions.
- Moreover, \( v \) is called a **harmonic conjugate** of \( u \) if \( f \) is analytic.

#### Important Examples:
- \( u = x^2 - y^2 \) and \( v = 2xy \) are harmonic conjugates because they satisfy the C-R equations.
- However, \( u = x^2 - y^2 \) and \( v = x^2 + y^2 \) are both harmonic but **not** harmonic conjugates.



### 3. ðŸ”¢ Elementary Functions in Complex Analysis

#### The Exponential Function \( e^z \)
- Defined by the power series:
\[
e^z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!}
\]
- It is an **entire function** (analytic everywhere).
- Key properties:
  - \( \frac{d}{dz} e^z = e^z \)
  - \( e^{z_1 + z_2} = e^{z_1} e^{z_2} \)
  - For real \( \theta \), Eulerâ€™s formula holds:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta
\]

#### Periodicity and Multi-Valuedness
- \( e^{z + 2n\pi i} = e^z \) for any integer \( n \), showing the exponential function is periodic in the imaginary direction.
- The inverse function, the logarithm, is therefore multi-valued.

#### Logarithm Function \( \log z \)
- Defined as the inverse of the exponential:
\[
\log z = \ln |z| + i \arg(z)
\]
- Because \( \arg(z) \) is multi-valued (differing by multiples of \( 2\pi \)), \( \log z \) is multi-valued.
- The **principal value** of the logarithm, denoted \( \text{Log}(z) \), restricts the argument to \( -\pi < \arg(z) \leq \pi \).

#### Properties of Logarithm:
- \( \exp(\text{Log}(z)) = z \)
- \( \text{Log}(x) = \ln x \) for positive real \( x \)
- Logarithm satisfies:
  - \( \log(z_1 z_2) = \log z_1 + \log z_2 \)
  - \( \log\left(\frac{z_1}{z_2}\right) = \log z_1 - \log z_2 \)
  - \( \log\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) = -\log z \)

#### Complex Powers
- For complex \( c \), define:
\[
z^c = e^{c \log z}
\]
- This definition inherits the multi-valued nature of the logarithm.



### 4. ðŸ”„ Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions in the Complex Plane

#### Complex Sine and Cosine
- Defined by their power series:
\[
\sin z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{z^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}, \quad \cos z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{z^{2n}}{(2n)!}
\]
- Using Eulerâ€™s formula:
\[
\sin z = \frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}, \quad \cos z = \frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}
\]
- For \( z = x + iy \), the sine and cosine can be expressed as:
\[
\sin z = \sin x \cosh y + i \cos x \sinh y
\]
\[
\cos z = \cos x \cosh y - i \sin x \sinh y
\]

#### Hyperbolic Functions
- Defined similarly:
\[
\cosh z = \frac{e^z + e^{-z}}{2}, \quad \sinh z = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{2}
\]
- These functions are entire and share many properties with their real counterparts.



### 5. ðŸ”„ Inverse Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions

#### Multi-Valued Nature
- Since trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are periodic, their inverses are multi-valued.
- The inverse functions are defined carefully using branch cuts and principal values.

#### Derivatives
- The derivatives of inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions can be found using implicit differentiation and are important in complex analysis.



### Summary

- **Analytic functions** are complex differentiable functions with strong properties, including the existence of derivatives and harmonic real and imaginary parts.
- **Cauchy-Riemann equations** provide a test for analyticity and link analytic functions to harmonic functions.
- **Elementary functions** like exponential, logarithm, sine, cosine, and their hyperbolic counterparts extend naturally to complex variables, often becoming multi-valued.
- Understanding **branch cuts** and **principal values** is essential for dealing with multi-valued functions like logarithms and inverse trigonometric functions.

#### 6. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are:  
**Correct:** A) \( u_x = v_y \) and \( u_y = -v_x \)

B) \( \exp(\text{Log}(z)) = z \) for all \( z \neq 0 \).  
D) \( \text{Log}(x + i0) = \ln x \) for \( x > 0 \).  
**Explanation:**  
- The principal value restricts the argument to the principal branch.  
- Exponentiating the principal log returns \( z \).  
- \( \text{Log} \) on positive real axis equals the natural log.  
- The logarithm addition property holds only modulo \( 2\pi i \), so C is not always true.



#### 11. Which of the following functions are entire?  
**Correct:** A) \( f(z) = z^5 + 3z + 1 \)  
C) \( f(z) = e^z \)

#### 17. Which of the following are true about the function \( f(z) = |z|^2 \)?  
**Correct:** B) It is nowhere analytic.  
C) It has no singular points.  
**Explanation:**  
- \( |z|^2 \) depends on both \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \), so it is not complex differentiable anywhere.  
- Since it is nowhere analytic, it has no isolated singularities.



#### 18. Which of the following are properties of the complex exponential function \( e^z \)?  
**Correct:** A) \( |e^z| = e^{\text{Re}(z)} \)
