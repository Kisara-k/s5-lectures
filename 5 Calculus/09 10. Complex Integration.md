## 10. Complex Integration

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on the lecture content you provided on **Complex Integration**. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step without skipping any important details.



## 1. 🧮 Introduction to Complex Integration

Complex integration extends the idea of integration from real-valued functions to complex-valued functions. Instead of integrating over a real interval, we integrate functions whose inputs and outputs are complex numbers. This is fundamental in complex analysis and has many applications in physics and engineering.



## 2. 📐 Complex Integrals: Definition and Basic Properties

#### What is a complex integral?

Suppose we have a complex-valued function \( f(t) = u(t) + i v(t) \), where \( u(t) \) and \( v(t) \) are real-valued functions of a real variable \( t \) defined on an interval \([a, b]\). If both \( u \) and \( v \) are continuous on \([a, b]\), then they are integrable in the usual real sense.

We define the integral of \( f(t) \) over \([a, b]\) as:

\[
\int_a^b f(t) \, dt = \int_a^b u(t) \, dt + i \int_a^b v(t) \, dt
\]

This means we integrate the real and imaginary parts separately, then combine them.

#### Fundamental theorem for complex integrals

If \( U(t) \) and \( V(t) \) are antiderivatives of \( u(t) \) and \( v(t) \) respectively (meaning \( U'(t) = u(t) \) and \( V'(t) = v(t) \)), then:

\[
\int_a^b f(t) \, dt = [U(b) - U(a)] + i [V(b) - V(a)]
\]

This is analogous to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for real functions.

#### Properties of complex integrals

If \( f(t) = u(t) + i v(t) \) and \( g(t) = p(t) + i q(t) \) are continuous on \([a, b]\), then:

1. **Linearity:** The integral of the sum is the sum of the integrals:

\[
\int_a^b [f(t) + g(t)] \, dt = \int_a^b f(t) \, dt + \int_a^b g(t) \, dt
\]

This property allows us to break down complex integrals into simpler parts.



## 3. 🧭 Contours and Contour Integrals

#### What is a contour?

In complex integration, instead of integrating over a real interval, we integrate over a path or curve in the complex plane. A **contour** is a curve made by joining a finite number of smooth curves end to end. For example, a polygonal path or a circle can be a contour.

#### Parametrizing a contour

To integrate over a contour \( C \), we describe it using a parameter \( t \) that runs from \( a \) to \( b \). The contour is given by a function:

\[
z(t) = x(t) + i y(t), \quad a \leq t \leq b
\]

where \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \) are real-valued functions describing the path in the plane.

#### Defining the contour integral

Given a complex function \( f(z) \) and a contour \( C \), the contour integral is defined as the limit of Riemann sums:

\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz := \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n f(c_k) \Delta z_k
\]

where:

- The contour \( C \) is partitioned into points \( z_0 = A, z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n = B \).
- \( \Delta z_k = z_k - z_{k-1} \) is the small segment along the contour.
- \( c_k \) is some point between \( z_{k-1} \) and \( z_k \).
- \( f(c_k) \) is the function evaluated at \( c_k \).

#### Using parametrization to evaluate contour integrals

If \( z(t) \) parametrizes \( C \), then the contour integral can be computed as:

\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz = \int_a^b f(z(t)) z'(t) \, dt
\]

This converts the complex contour integral into a standard integral over a real interval.



## 4. 🔍 Important Inequalities in Complex Integration

#### Integral Triangle Inequality

For a continuous complex function \( f(t) = u(t) + i v(t) \), the absolute value of the integral is bounded by the integral of the absolute value:

\[
\left| \int_a^b f(t) \, dt \right| \leq \int_a^b |f(t)| \, dt
\]

This inequality is useful for estimating the size of integrals.

#### ML Inequality (Maximum Length Inequality)

If \( f(z) \) is continuous on a contour \( C \) of length \( L \), and \( M \) is an upper bound for \( |f(z)| \) on \( C \), then:

\[
\left| \int_C f(z) \, dz \right| \leq M L
\]

This means the absolute value of the contour integral is at most the product of the maximum magnitude of the function on the contour and the length of the contour. This is a powerful tool for bounding integrals without computing them exactly.



## 5. 🌀 Cauchy-Goursat Theorem and Its Consequences

#### What is the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem?

This is a fundamental result in complex analysis. It states:

If \( f \) is **analytic** (complex differentiable) in a simply connected domain \( D \), and \( C \) is any simple closed contour lying entirely in \( D \), then:

\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz = 0
\]

This means the integral of an analytic function around a closed loop is zero, provided the function is analytic everywhere inside the loop.

#### Why is this important?

This theorem shows that the value of contour integrals depends only on the endpoints if the function is analytic, and that integrals around closed loops vanish. It is the foundation for many results in complex analysis, including Cauchy's integral formula and residue theory.

#### Deformation of contour lemma

If \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are two simple closed contours, with \( C_1 \) lying inside \( C_2 \), and \( f \) is analytic in the region between them, then:

\[
\int_{C_1} f(z) \, dz = \int_{C_2} f(z) \, dz
\]

This means you can continuously deform one contour into another without changing the value of the integral, as long as you don't cross any singularities.

#### Extended Cauchy-Goursat Theorem

If you have multiple simple closed contours \( C, C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n \) such that each \( C_k \) lies inside \( C \) and the interiors of the \( C_k \) do not overlap, and \( f \) is analytic in the domain containing all these contours and the region between them, then:

\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz = \sum_{k=1}^n \int_{C_k} f(z) \, dz
\]

This allows breaking down integrals over complicated regions into sums of integrals over simpler contours.



## 6. 🧩 Examples and Applications

#### Example: Parametrizing a polygonal path

Suppose you want to find the parametrization of a polygonal path \( C \) from \( -1 + i \) to \( 3 - i \). You break the path into line segments and express each segment as a function of \( t \), then combine them to describe the entire contour.

#### Example: Evaluating integrals using parametrization

To evaluate \( \int_C e^z \, dz \) where \( C \) is a line segment from \( 0 \) to \( 2 + 4i \), parametrize \( C \) as \( z(t) = t(2 + 4i) \), \( t \in [0,1] \), then compute:

\[
\int_0^1 e^{z(t)} z'(t) \, dt
\]

#### Example: Using ML inequality to bound integrals

If \( C \) is a circle of radius \( R > 3 \) centered at the origin, and you want to bound:

\[
\left| \int_C (z^2 + 9)^2 \, dz \right|
\]

You find the maximum value \( M \) of \( |(z^2 + 9)^2| \) on \( C \), then multiply by the length \( L = 2 \pi R \) to get an upper bound.

#### Example: Cauchy-Goursat theorem in action

If \( C \) is the circle \( |z| = 2 \), then for the function \( f(z) = z^2 + 2 \), which is analytic everywhere, the integral over \( C \) is zero by the theorem.

#### 1.  
**Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** The integral of a complex function \( f(t) = u(t) + i v(t) \) is defined by integrating the real and imaginary parts separately:

- B is too restrictive.



#### 18.  
**Answer:** B
