       "\n",
       "Green‚Äôs Theorem is a fundamental result in vector calculus that creates a powerful link between a line integral around a closed curve and a double integral over the region enclosed by that curve. It essentially allows us to convert a complicated line integral into a (sometimes simpler) double integral, or vice versa.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### What is Green‚Äôs Theorem?\n",
       "\n",
       "Suppose you have a region $ D $ in the plane that is **simply connected** (meaning it has no holes) and is bounded by a closed, piecewise smooth curve $ C $. The curve $ C $ is oriented positively, which means it is traversed counterclockwise so that the region $ D $ is always on the left as you move along $ C $.\n",

       "\n",
       "- The left side is a **line integral** around the curve $ C $.\n",
       "- The right side is a **double integral** over the area $ D $.\n",
       "\n",
       "This theorem essentially says that the circulation of the vector field $ \\mathbf{F} = M\\mathbf{i} + N\\mathbf{j} $ around the boundary $ C $ equals the total \"curl\" (or rotation) of the field inside $ D $.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Why is this useful?\n",
       "\n",
       "- It simplifies calculations: sometimes the double integral is easier to evaluate than the line integral.\n",
