## Study Notes

### 1. üìê Introduction to Vector Fields

Vector calculus begins with the concept of **vector fields**, which are fundamental in describing physical phenomena like fluid flow, electromagnetic fields, and forces.

A **vector field** in three-dimensional space (‚Ñù¬≥) is a function that assigns a vector to every point in a region of space. Formally, if the domain is $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$, a vector field $\mathbf{F}$ can be written as:


$$
\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = M(x, y, z) \mathbf{i} + N(x, y, z) \mathbf{j} + P(x, y, z) \mathbf{k}
$$


Here, $M, N, P$ are scalar functions representing the components of the vector field along the $x, y, z$ directions respectively.

- If $M, N, P$ are continuous functions, then $\mathbf{F}$ is called a **continuous vector field**.
- If all partial derivatives of $M, N, P$ exist and are continuous, then $\mathbf{F}$ is a **differentiable vector field**.

#### Special Types of Vector Fields

- **Inverse-square field:** A vector field of the form


$$
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{c \mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{r}|^3}
$$


where $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector and $c$ is a constant, is called an inverse-square field. This type of field appears in physics, for example, in **Coulomb‚Äôs Law** describing the electric field around a point charge.


### 2. üåü Gradient and Conservative Vector Fields

#### Gradient of a Scalar Function

If $\phi(x, y, z)$ is a scalar function of three variables, its **gradient** is a vector field defined as:


$$
\nabla \phi = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \mathbf{j} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} \mathbf{k}
$$


- The gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of $\phi$.
- The magnitude of the gradient gives the rate of increase in that direction.
- The operator $\nabla$ (called the **del operator**) is a vector differential operator.

#### Conservative Vector Fields

A vector field $\mathbf{F}$ is called **conservative** if it can be expressed as the gradient of some scalar function $\phi$:


$$
\mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi
$$


- The function $\phi$ is called the **potential function** of $\mathbf{F}$.
- Conservative fields have important properties, such as path independence of line integrals (work done depends only on start and end points).


### 3. üîÑ Divergence, Curl, and Laplacian

These are key differential operators used to analyze vector fields.

#### Divergence

For a vector field


$$
\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = f(x, y, z) \mathbf{i} + g(x, y, z) \mathbf{j} + h(x, y, z) \mathbf{k}
$$


the **divergence** is a scalar function defined as:


$$
\text{div} \, \mathbf{F} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial h}{\partial z}
$$


- Divergence measures the net rate of "flow" out of a point.
- Physically, it represents sources or sinks in a field (e.g., fluid flow expanding or compressing).

#### Curl

The **curl** of $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector field defined as:


$$
\text{curl} \, \mathbf{F} = \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left( \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial g}{\partial z} \right) \mathbf{i} - \left( \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right) \mathbf{j} + \left( \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right) \mathbf{k}
$$


- Curl measures the tendency of the field to induce rotation or "circulation" around a point.
- A zero curl indicates the field is irrotational.

#### Laplacian

The **Laplacian** operator applied to a scalar function $\phi$ is:


$$
\nabla^2 \phi = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial z^2}
$$


- It can also be expressed as the divergence of the gradient: $\nabla^2 \phi = \text{div}(\nabla \phi)$.
- The equation $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$ is called **Laplace‚Äôs equation**, fundamental in physics and engineering for steady-state heat flow, electrostatics, and fluid flow.


### 4. ‚û∞ Line Integrals

Line integrals extend the concept of integration to functions defined along curves in space.

#### Scalar Line Integrals

If $f$ is a scalar function defined on a smooth curve $C$ parameterized by


$$
x = x(t), \quad y = y(t), \quad z = z(t), \quad a \leq t \leq b
$$


then the **line integral** of $f$ over $C$ is:


$$
\int_C f \, ds = \int_a^b f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
$$


- Here, $ds$ represents an infinitesimal arc length along the curve.
- Intuitively, this integral sums the values of $f$ weighted by the length of the curve.
- If $f \geq 0$, the integral can be interpreted as the area of a "sheet" formed by moving a vertical segment of height $f$ along the curve.

#### Vector Line Integrals

If $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector field and $C$ is a piecewise smooth oriented curve parameterized by $\mathbf{r}(t)$, then the **line integral of $\mathbf{F}$ along $C$** is:


$$
\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_a^b \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) \, dt
$$


- This integral represents the work done by the force field $\mathbf{F}$ on a particle moving along $C$.
- The dot product ensures only the component of $\mathbf{F}$ tangent to the curve contributes.


### 5. üîÑ Independence of Path and Conservative Fields

#### Work Done by a Force Field

When a particle moves under a force field $\mathbf{F}$ along a curve $C$, the **work done** is given by the line integral:


$$
W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
$$


#### Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals

If $\mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi$ for some scalar function $\phi$, then for a curve $C$ from point $A$ to point $B$:


$$
\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \phi(B) - \phi(A)
$$


- This means the work done depends only on the endpoints, not on the path taken.
- Such vector fields are called **conservative**.

#### Closed Curves and Simply Connected Regions

- A **closed curve** is one where the start and end points coincide.
- A region $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is **connected** if any two points in $D$ can be joined by a curve lying entirely in $D$.
- A connected region is **simply connected** if every closed curve in $D$ encloses only points inside $D$ (no holes).

#### Equivalence of Conditions for Conservative Fields

In a connected, open region $D$, the following are equivalent for a vector field $\mathbf{F}$:

- $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative (i.e., $\mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi$ for some $\phi$).
- The line integral of $\mathbf{F}$ around every closed curve in $D$ is zero.
- The line integral of $\mathbf{F}$ between any two points in $D$ is independent of the path taken.

#### Conservative Field Test (in 2D)

For a vector field $\mathbf{F} = f(x,y) \mathbf{i} + g(x,y) \mathbf{j}$ with continuous first partial derivatives in a simply connected region $D$, $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative if and only if:


$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}
$$


This condition ensures the curl of $\mathbf{F}$ is zero in 2D, indicating no rotational component.


### 6. üßÆ Examples and Applications

#### Example 1: Line Integral of a Scalar Function

Evaluate


$$
\int_C x^2 z \, ds
$$


where $C$ is the helix parameterized by


$$
x = \cos t, \quad y = 2t, \quad z = \sin t, \quad 0 \leq t \leq \pi
$$


- Compute $ds = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} dt$.
- Substitute $x(t), z(t)$ into the integrand.
- Integrate over $t$ from 0 to $\pi$.

#### Example 2: Vector Line Integral

Given $\mathbf{F} = y \mathbf{i} + x \mathbf{j}$ and $C$ is the top half of the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 4$ traversed counterclockwise from (2,0) to (-2,0):

- Parameterize $C$ as $x = 2 \cos \theta, y = 2 \sin \theta, 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$.
- Compute $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(\theta)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(\theta)$.
- Integrate over $\theta$.

#### Example 3: Checking if a Vector Field is Conservative

Given


$$
\mathbf{F} = (e^x \sin y - y) \mathbf{i} + (e^x \cos y - x - 2) \mathbf{j}
$$


- Check if $\frac{\partial}{\partial y} (e^x \sin y - y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (e^x \cos y - x - 2)$.
- If equal, $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative.
- Find the potential function $\phi$ by integrating components.
