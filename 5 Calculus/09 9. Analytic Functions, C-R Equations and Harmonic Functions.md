## 9. Analytic Functions, C-R Equations and Harmonic Functions

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on the lecture content you provided. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step without skipping any important details.



### 1. 🧮 Analytic Functions: What They Are and Examples

When we talk about **analytic functions** in complex analysis, we mean functions that are "nice" enough to have a complex derivative at every point in some region. This is stronger than just having a derivative at a single point; the function must be differentiable in a whole neighborhood around that point.

#### What Does It Mean for a Function to be Analytic?

A function \( f(z) \) is **analytic** at a point \( z_0 \) if it has a complex derivative at every point in some open neighborhood around \( z_0 \). If a function is analytic everywhere in the complex plane (except possibly at infinity), it is called **entire**.

#### Examples of Analytic and Non-Analytic Functions

- **Example 1:** \( f(z) = \frac{1}{z} \) is analytic everywhere except at \( z = 0 \) because the function is well-defined and differentiable at all other points.
  
- **Example 2:** \( f(z) = |z|^2 \) is **not analytic anywhere** except possibly at \( z=0 \), but even there, it does not have a derivative in any neighborhood. This is because the absolute value function depends on both \( z \) and its conjugate \( \bar{z} \), breaking the complex differentiability condition.

- **Example 3:** Every polynomial function (like \( f(z) = z^2 + 3z + 1 \)) is **entire** because polynomials are differentiable everywhere in the complex plane.

#### Singular Points (Singularities)

A **singular point** is a point where a function fails to be analytic, but it is analytic in every neighborhood around that point (except possibly at the point itself).

- **Isolated singularity:** There exists a small radius \( \delta \) such that the function is analytic everywhere in the punctured disk \( 0 < |z - a| < \delta \), but not analytic at \( z = a \) itself. For example, \( z=0 \) is an isolated singularity of \( f(z) = \frac{1}{z} \).

- **Non-isolated singularities:** These are singular points that are not isolated. For example, branch cuts like those for \( \log(z) \) or \( \sqrt{z} \) along the negative real axis are non-isolated singularities.

#### Important Properties of Analytic Functions

- The sum, product, and quotient (where denominator is non-zero) of analytic functions are analytic.
- The composition of analytic functions is analytic.
- If the derivative of a function is zero everywhere in a domain, the function must be constant in that domain.



### 2. 📐 Cauchy-Riemann (C-R) Equations and Harmonic Functions

#### What Are Cauchy-Riemann Equations?

For a complex function \( f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \) to be analytic, the real part \( u \) and imaginary part \( v \) must satisfy the **Cauchy-Riemann equations**:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
\]

These equations ensure the function behaves nicely with respect to complex differentiation.

#### Harmonic Functions

A **harmonic function** is a real-valued function \( H(x,y) \) that satisfies **Laplace's equation**:

\[
H_{xx} + H_{yy} = 0
\]

where \( H_{xx} \) and \( H_{yy} \) are the second partial derivatives with respect to \( x \) and \( y \).

- If \( f(z) = u + iv \) is analytic, then both \( u \) and \( v \) are harmonic functions.
- Two functions \( u \) and \( v \) are **harmonic conjugates** if \( f(z) = u + iv \) is analytic.

#### Examples and Applications

- The function \( T(x,y) = e^{-y} \sin x \) is harmonic because it satisfies Laplace's equation.
- If \( u = x^2 - y^2 \) and \( v = x^2 + y^2 \), both are harmonic but **not harmonic conjugates** because they do not satisfy the C-R equations.
- Finding a harmonic conjugate involves solving the C-R equations to find \( v \) given \( u \), or vice versa.



### 3. 🔢 Elementary Functions in Complex Analysis

#### The Exponential Function \( e^z \)

The exponential function is defined by its power series:

\[
e^z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!}
\]

This function is **entire** (analytic everywhere) and has important properties:

- \( \frac{d}{dz} e^z = e^z \)
- \( e^{z_1 + z_2} = e^{z_1} e^{z_2} \)
- For real \( \theta \), Euler's formula: \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \)

#### Periodicity and Multi-Valuedness

- \( e^{z + 2n\pi i} = e^z \) for any integer \( n \), showing the exponential function is periodic in the imaginary direction.
- The inverse function, the logarithm, is therefore **multi-valued**.

#### The Logarithm Function \( \log z \)

Defined as the inverse of the exponential:

\[
\log z = \ln |z| + i \arg(z)
\]

Because the argument \( \arg(z) \) is multi-valued (differing by multiples of \( 2\pi \)), the logarithm is multi-valued.

- The **principal value** of the logarithm, denoted \( \text{Log}(z) \), restricts the argument to \( -\pi < \arg(z) \leq \pi \).
- Properties include:
  - \( \exp(\text{Log}(z)) = z \)
  - \( \text{Log}(x) = \ln x \) for positive real \( x \)
  - \( \log(z_1 z_2) = \log(z_1) + \log(z_2) \) (with care about branches)

#### Complex Powers

For complex \( c \), define:

\[
z^c = \exp(c \log z)
\]

This definition depends on the branch of the logarithm chosen, so complex powers are also multi-valued.



### 4. 🔄 Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions in the Complex Plane

#### Complex Sine and Cosine

The sine and cosine functions extend naturally to complex arguments via their power series:

\[
\sin z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{z^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}, \quad \cos z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{z^{2n}}{(2n)!}
\]

Using Euler's formula:

\[
\sin z = \frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}, \quad \cos z = \frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}
\]

For \( z = x + iy \), these can be expressed as:

\[
\sin z = \sin x \cosh y + i \cos x \sinh y
\]
\[
\cos z = \cos x \cosh y - i \sin x \sinh y
\]

#### Hyperbolic Functions

Defined similarly:

\[
\cosh z = \frac{e^z + e^{-z}}{2}, \quad \sinh z = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{2}
\]

These functions share many properties with their real counterparts but are defined for complex arguments.



### 5. 🔄 Inverse Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions

Because trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are periodic and many-to-one, their inverses are **multi-valued**.

- The inverse trigonometric functions (like \( \sin^{-1} z \)) and inverse hyperbolic functions (like \( \tanh^{-1} z \)) are defined carefully using logarithms and branch cuts.
- Their derivatives can be found using implicit differentiation and are important in complex analysis.

**Correct:** A) \( f(z) = \frac{1}{z} \)  
**Explanation:** \( \frac{1}{z} \) is analytic everywhere except at \( z=0 \) where it has a singularity. \( |z|^2 \) is not analytic anywhere except possibly at 0 but not in any neighborhood. Polynomials are entire (analytic everywhere), and \( \log z \) is analytic except on branch cuts.
