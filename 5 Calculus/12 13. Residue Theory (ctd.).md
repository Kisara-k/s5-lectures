## 13. Residue Theory (ctd.)

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on the lecture content you provided on Residue Theory, focusing on evaluating real integrals using residues. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step.



## 1. 🧮 Introduction to Residue Theory and Real Integrals

Residue Theory is a powerful tool in complex analysis that allows us to evaluate complex contour integrals by examining the singularities (poles) of a function inside a contour. One of the most exciting applications of this theory is its ability to evaluate certain real integrals—especially those that are difficult or impossible to solve using standard calculus techniques.

Throughout the course, you have learned that integrals over curves in three-dimensional space or contours in the complex plane can often be transformed into integrals over real line segments by using appropriate parametrizations. Residue Theory works in the reverse direction: it uses complex analysis to solve real integrals by extending the integral into the complex plane and then applying the residue theorem.

This section focuses on how residues can be used to evaluate real integrals, including trigonometric integrals, improper integrals of rational functions, and integrals involving sine and cosine functions multiplied by rational functions.



## 2. 🎯 Evaluating Trigonometric Integrals Using Residues

Trigonometric integrals often appear in calculus and engineering, and some of them can be evaluated elegantly using residues.

#### Example 1:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1 + 3 \cos^2 \theta}{5 - 4 \cos \theta} \, d\theta = \pi
\]

This integral involves trigonometric functions in the numerator and denominator. By expressing cosine in terms of complex exponentials (using Euler’s formula \( e^{i\theta} \)), the integral can be converted into a contour integral over the unit circle in the complex plane. Then, by identifying the poles inside the unit circle and calculating their residues, the integral evaluates to \(\pi\).

#### Example 2:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{5 - 4 \cos \theta} \, d\theta = 6
\]

Similar to the first example, this integral can be tackled by converting the trigonometric functions into complex exponentials and applying the residue theorem.



## 3. 📏 Improper Integrals of Rational Functions

Improper integrals are integrals where the interval of integration is infinite or the integrand has singularities. Residue theory provides a method to evaluate these integrals, especially when the integrand is a rational function (a ratio of polynomials).

#### Definition of Improper Integral:

- If \( f \) is continuous on \([0, \infty)\), the improper integral is defined as:
\[
\int_0^\infty f(x) \, dx := \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b f(x) \, dx
\]
provided the limit exists.

- If \( f \) is defined on all real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\), the integral over \((-\infty, \infty)\) is:
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \, dx := \lim_{a \to -\infty} \int_a^0 f(x) \, dx + \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b f(x) \, dx
\]
if both limits exist.

- The **Cauchy Principal Value (P.V.)** is a way to assign a value to some improper integrals that might not converge in the usual sense:
\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \, dx := \lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{-R}^R f(x) \, dx
\]
if this limit exists.

#### Example of Principal Value:
\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, dx = \lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{-R}^R x \, dx = \lim_{R \to \infty} \left[ \frac{x^2}{2} \right]_{-R}^R = \lim_{R \to \infty} 0 = 0
\]
Even though the integral \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, dx\) does not exist in the usual sense, its principal value is zero.



## 4. 🧮 Theorem 13.3.1: Evaluating Principal Value Integrals of Rational Functions

This theorem provides a way to evaluate the principal value of integrals of rational functions using residues.

#### Statement:
Let
\[
f(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}
\]
where \(P\) and \(Q\) are polynomials of degrees \(m\) and \(n\) respectively. Suppose:

- \(Q(x) \neq 0\) for all real \(x\) (no real poles),
- \(n \geq m + 2\) (degree of denominator at least two more than numerator).

Then,
\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \, dx = 2\pi i \sum \text{Res}\left[\frac{P}{Q}, z_j\right]
\]
where the sum is over all poles \(z_j\) of \(f\) in the **upper half-plane** (complex numbers with positive imaginary part).

#### Intuition:
- The condition \(n \geq m + 2\) ensures the function decays fast enough at infinity for the integral to converge.
- The poles in the upper half-plane contribute to the integral via their residues.
- The integral over the real line is related to the sum of residues inside a semicircular contour in the upper half-plane.

#### Examples:
- \(P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x^2 + 1}{(x^2 + 4)^2} \, dx\)
- \(P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{(x^2 + 4)^3} \, dx\)

These can be evaluated by finding the poles of the integrand in the upper half-plane and summing their residues multiplied by \(2\pi i\).



## 5. 🎵 Theorem 13.3.2: Convergence of Integrals with Trigonometric Factors

This theorem addresses integrals of the form:
\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \cos(x) \, dx \quad \text{and} \quad P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \sin(x) \, dx
\]

#### Statement:
If \(P\) and \(Q\) are polynomials with degrees \(m\) and \(n\) respectively, \(n \geq m + 1\), and \(Q(x) \neq 0\) for all real \(x\), then these integrals **converge**.

#### Explanation:
- The presence of \(\cos(x)\) or \(\sin(x)\) oscillates the integrand, which helps the integral converge even if the rational function alone might not.
- The degree condition ensures the rational function does not grow too fast at infinity.



## 6. 🔄 Theorem 13.3.3: Evaluating Integrals with Exponential and Trigonometric Factors Using Residues

This theorem extends the residue method to integrals involving exponential functions with imaginary arguments, which relate directly to sine and cosine integrals.

#### Setup:
Let
\[
f(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)} e^{i \alpha z}
\]
where \(\alpha > 0\), and \(P, Q\) are polynomials with degrees \(m\) and \(n\) respectively, \(n \geq m + 1\), and \(Q(x) \neq 0\) for all real \(x\).

#### Results:
- The principal value integral involving cosine:
\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \cos(\alpha x) \, dx = -2\pi \sum \operatorname{Im} \left( \text{Res}[f, z_j] \right)
\]
- The principal value integral involving sine:
\[
P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \sin(\alpha x) \, dx = 2\pi \sum \operatorname{Re} \left( \text{Res}[f, z_j] \right)
\]

where the sum is over all poles \(z_j\) of \(f\) in the upper half-plane.

#### Explanation:
- The exponential \(e^{i \alpha z}\) encodes both sine and cosine via Euler’s formula:
\[
e^{i \alpha x} = \cos(\alpha x) + i \sin(\alpha x)
\]
- By considering the residues of \(f(z)\) in the upper half-plane, we can extract the real and imaginary parts corresponding to sine and cosine integrals.
- This method is especially useful for integrals that combine rational functions with oscillatory factors.

#### Examples:
- \(P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x \sin x}{x^2 + 4} \, dx = e^2\)
- \(P.V. \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\cos x}{x^4 + 4} \, dx = \pi (\cos 1 + \sin 1)\)

These results come from calculating the residues of the corresponding complex function \(f(z)\) and applying the theorem.



## Summary

Residue Theory provides a powerful framework to evaluate real integrals, especially improper integrals involving rational functions and trigonometric factors. The key steps involve:

1. Extending the integral into the complex plane.
2. Identifying the poles of the integrand in the upper half-plane.
3. Calculating the residues at these poles.
4. Using the residue theorem to relate the sum of residues to the value of the integral.

This approach can solve integrals that are otherwise very challenging, including those with infinite limits and oscillatory integrands.
