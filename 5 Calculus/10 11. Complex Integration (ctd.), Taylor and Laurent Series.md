## Study Notes on Complex Integration, Taylor and Laurent Series



### 1. 🧮 Fundamental Theorems of Complex Integration

In complex analysis, integration plays a central role, especially when dealing with analytic functions—functions that are complex differentiable in a domain. The fundamental theorems here extend the familiar ideas of calculus into the complex plane.

#### 1.1 Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integrals

If a function \( f \) is analytic (complex differentiable everywhere) in a simply connected domain \( D \), then for any fixed point \( z_0 \in D \), we can define a function \( F(z) \) by integrating \( f \) along any contour \( C_z \) in \( D \) starting at \( z_0 \) and ending at \( z \):

\[
F(z) := \int_{C_z} f(\zeta) \, d\zeta
\]

This function \( F \) is itself analytic in \( D \), and importantly, its derivative is the original function:

\[
F'(z) = f(z)
\]

This means \( F \) is an antiderivative of \( f \) in the complex plane, analogous to indefinite integrals in real calculus.

#### 1.2 Definite Integrals and the Fundamental Theorem

If \( f \) is analytic in a simply connected domain \( D \), and \( z_0, z_1 \in D \), then the integral of \( f \) from \( z_0 \) to \( z_1 \) along any contour in \( D \) depends only on the endpoints:

\[
\int_{z_0}^{z_1} f(z) \, dz = F(z_1) - F(z_0)
\]

where \( F \) is any antiderivative of \( f \). This is a powerful result because it means contour integrals of analytic functions in simply connected domains are path-independent.



### 2. 🔄 Integral Representation of Analytic Functions (Cauchy's Integral Formula)

One of the most important results in complex analysis is **Cauchy's Integral Formula**, which provides a way to represent the value of an analytic function inside a contour in terms of an integral over the contour.

#### 2.1 Cauchy's Integral Formula

Suppose \( f \) is analytic in a simply connected domain \( D \), and \( C \) is a simple closed contour inside \( D \) oriented positively (counterclockwise). If \( z_0 \) is a point inside \( C \), then:

\[
f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} \, dz
\]

This formula tells us that the value of \( f \) at \( z_0 \) can be recovered exactly by integrating \( f \) around a contour enclosing \( z_0 \).

#### 2.2 Cauchy's Integral Formula for Derivatives

This formula extends to derivatives of \( f \). For the \( n \)-th derivative of \( f \) at \( z_0 \):

\[
f^{(n)}(z_0) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{f(z)}{(z - z_0)^{n+1}} \, dz
\]

This is remarkable because it expresses derivatives of all orders as contour integrals, linking differentiation and integration in complex analysis.



### 3. 📈 Taylor and Laurent Series: Power Series Representations of Analytic Functions

Analytic functions can be expressed as infinite sums of powers of \( (z - \alpha) \), where \( \alpha \) is the center of expansion. These series provide powerful tools for understanding and approximating complex functions.

#### 3.1 Convergence of Sequences and Series of Functions

Before diving into series, it’s important to understand how sequences of functions converge:

- **Pointwise convergence** means for each fixed \( z \), the sequence \( f_n(z) \) approaches \( f(z) \) as \( n \to \infty \).
- **Uniform convergence** is stronger: the sequence \( f_n \) converges to \( f \) uniformly if for every small tolerance \( \epsilon \), beyond some \( N \), all \( f_n(z) \) are within \( \epsilon \) of \( f(z) \) for *all* \( z \) in the domain simultaneously.

Uniform convergence ensures continuity and allows interchange of limits and integrals, which is crucial for power series.

#### 3.2 Power Series and Radius of Convergence

A **power series** centered at \( \alpha \) is:

\[
f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (z - \alpha)^n
\]

The set of points where this series converges is either:

- Just the point \( z = \alpha \),
- A disk \( D_\rho(\alpha) = \{ z : |z - \alpha| < \rho \} \),
- Or the entire complex plane.

The number \( \rho \) is called the **radius of convergence**. Inside this radius, the series converges absolutely and uniformly on any smaller closed disk.

#### 3.3 Taylor and Maclaurin Series

If \( f \) is analytic at \( \alpha \), it can be represented by its **Taylor series**:

\[
f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(k)}(\alpha)}{k!} (z - \alpha)^k
\]

When \( \alpha = 0 \), this is called the **Maclaurin series**.

Taylor's theorem guarantees that this series converges to \( f(z) \) inside the largest disk contained in the domain of analyticity.

#### 3.4 Uniqueness and Operations on Power Series

- The power series representation of an analytic function is unique.
- Power series can be added, multiplied, and scaled term-by-term.
- The product of two power series is given by the **Cauchy product** formula:

\[
(fg)(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (z - \alpha)^n, \quad \text{where } c_n = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}
\]



### 4. 🌀 Laurent Series: Extending Power Series to Annuli

Sometimes functions are analytic not in a disk but in an annulus (a ring-shaped region). For such functions, the Taylor series is not sufficient, and we use the **Laurent series**.

#### 4.1 Definition of Laurent Series

A Laurent series centered at \( \alpha \) is a doubly infinite series:

\[
f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty c_n (z - \alpha)^n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_{-n} (z - \alpha)^{-n} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (z - \alpha)^n
\]

This series includes negative powers, allowing representation of functions with singularities (points where the function "blows up") inside the annulus.

#### 4.2 Annulus and Convergence

An **annulus** is defined as:

\[
A(r, R, \alpha) = \{ z : r < |z - \alpha| < R \}
\]

where \( 0 \leq r < R \). The Laurent series converges uniformly on any closed sub-annulus inside \( A(r, R, \alpha) \).

#### 4.3 Laurent's Theorem

If \( f \) is analytic in an annulus \( A(r, R, \alpha) \), then \( f \) can be represented by a Laurent series converging in that annulus. The coefficients \( c_n \) are given by contour integrals:

\[
c_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C_\rho^+(\alpha)} \frac{f(z)}{(z - \alpha)^{n+1}} \, dz
\]

where \( C_\rho^+(\alpha) \) is a positively oriented circle of radius \( \rho \) with \( r < \rho < R \).

#### 4.4 Properties of Laurent Series

- The Laurent series representation is unique.
- Derivatives of \( f \) can be obtained by differentiating the Laurent series term-by-term.
- Laurent series generalize Taylor series by allowing negative powers, which is essential for describing functions with isolated singularities.



### 5. 📝 Summary of Key Concepts and Examples

- **Analytic functions** have antiderivatives and path-independent integrals in simply connected domains.
- **Cauchy's integral formula** allows evaluation of function values and derivatives via contour integrals.
- **Power series (Taylor/Maclaurin)** represent analytic functions inside disks of convergence.
- **Uniform convergence** is crucial for exchanging limits and integrals.
- **Laurent series** extend power series to annuli, including negative powers to handle singularities.
- The coefficients of Laurent series are computed by contour integrals around circles inside the annulus.



#### Examples to Reinforce Understanding

- Evaluating integrals like \( \int \cos z \, dz \) or \( \int \frac{e^z}{z-1} dz \) using Cauchy's formula.
- Showing uniform convergence of geometric series inside disks.
- Finding Taylor series for functions like \( \sin z \) and then powers like \( \sin^3 z \).
- Constructing Laurent series for functions analytic in annuli, such as \( \frac{\cos z - 1}{z^4} \).



This concludes the detailed study note on complex integration, Taylor, and Laurent series. Understanding these concepts is fundamental for deeper studies in complex analysis, especially in evaluating complex integrals and analyzing singularities of complex functions.

## Answers

Certainly! Below are the correct answers for each question along with brief explanations.



#### 1.  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:** If \( f \) is analytic in a simply connected domain, the integral defining \( F \) is path-independent, so \( F \) is analytic and \( F'(z) = f(z) \). \( F \) does **not** depend on the path, and it is not constant unless \( f \equiv 0 \).



#### 2.  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:** Cauchy's Integral Formula implies \( f \) is infinitely differentiable (analytic) inside \( C \), and \( f(z_0) \) can be recovered exactly from values on \( C \). The integral depends on orientation (positive orientation is required) and applies to complex-valued analytic functions, not just real-valued.

- (D) If \( \rho = \infty \), series converges everywhere.



#### 4.  
**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:** Uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence and allows interchange of limit and integral. Pointwise convergence does **not** imply uniform convergence, and it does not guarantee continuity of the limit function.



#### 5.  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** Taylor series converges inside the largest disk contained in the domain of analyticity, coefficients are given by derivatives at \( \alpha \), and the series is unique. It does **not** always converge for all \( z \).

Radius of convergence of product is **not** the sum of radii.



#### 7.  
**Correct:** A, B, C, D

#### 8.  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** Laurent coefficients are computed by contour integrals, series converges uniformly on closed sub-annuli, and term-wise differentiation is valid. The representation is unique, so (C) is false.



#### 9.  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:** The integral equals \( \frac{2\pi i}{n!} f^{(n)}(z_0) \) and can be used to compute derivatives. It does **not** depend on the shape of \( C \) (only on winding number), and it is **not** zero for \( n=0 \) (it equals \( 2\pi i f(z_0) \)).



#### 10.  
**Correct:** A, C, D  
**Explanation:** Radius of convergence equals distance to nearest singularity, Taylor series converges inside this radius, and convergence is uniform on closed disks inside radius. It does **not** converge beyond singularities.



#### 11.  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- (A) Cauchy product formula for coefficients is correct.  
- (B) Absolute convergence of both series implies convergence of product.  
- (D) Cauchy product can be used to find series like \( (1 - z)^2 \).  
Radius of convergence of product is **not** sum of radii.



#### 12.  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** Geometric series converges pointwise for \( |z| < 1 \), uniformly on closed disks inside unit disk, and sums to \( \frac{1}{1-z} \). It does **not** converge on the boundary \( |z|=1 \) in general.



#### 13.  
**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:** Analyticity implies differentiability of all orders and local power series representation. Differentiability at a single point does **not** imply analyticity in a neighborhood. Functions with isolated singularities are not analytic at those points but can be analytic elsewhere.

**Explanation:**  
- (B) Integral over open contour depends only on endpoints if \( f \) analytic.

#### 15.  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:** Uniform convergence preserves continuity and allows interchange of limit and integral. It is **stronger** than pointwise convergence and does **not** depend on \( z \) (uniform means independent of \( z \)).



#### 16.  
**Correct:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:** Laurent coefficients are computed by contour integrals, negative indices correspond to negative powers, and \( c_0 \) is the constant term. Not all coefficients must be zero in a disk; negative powers vanish in Taylor series but not necessarily in Laurent series.

#### 18.  
**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:** Power series representation is unique if they agree on a disk, so coefficients must be identical. Taylor series is the unique power series representation of an analytic function. Different power series cannot represent the same function in the same domain. Uniqueness does **not** fail due to singularities.



#### 19.  
**Correct:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**  
- (A) Definition of annulus is correct.  
- (B) Functions analytic in annulus can have singularities on inner boundary.  
- (C) Laurent series converge in annuli and also reduce to Taylor series in disks (special case).  
(D) Annulus does **not** necessarily include boundary circles unless specified as closed annulus.



#### 20.  
**Correct:** A, B  
**Explanation:** Term-wise differentiation of power and Laurent series is valid within their domains of convergence. Differentiation does **not** change radius of convergence, nor does it introduce new singularities (it may increase order of existing singularities but not create new ones).
