## 5. Vector Calculus

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized, and clear study note based on your lecture content on **Vector Calculus**. I have expanded explanations, clarified key concepts, and structured the note with numbered main headings and emojis for clarity.



## 1. üìê Introduction to Vector Fields

Vector calculus begins with the concept of **vector fields**, which are fundamental in describing physical phenomena like fluid flow, electromagnetic fields, and forces.

A **vector field** in three-dimensional space (‚Ñù¬≥) is a function that assigns a vector to every point in a region of space. Formally, if the domain is \( D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3 \), then a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) is written as:

\[
\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = M(x, y, z) \mathbf{i} + N(x, y, z) \mathbf{j} + P(x, y, z) \mathbf{k}
\]

Here, \( M, N, P \) are scalar functions representing the components of the vector field along the \( x, y, z \) directions respectively. The vectors \( \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k} \) are the standard unit vectors along these axes.

- A **continuous vector field** means each component function \( M, N, P \) is continuous.
- A **differentiable vector field** means all partial derivatives of \( M, N, P \) exist.

#### Special Example: Inverse-Square Field

An important type of vector field is the **inverse-square field**, which appears in physics, such as in Coulomb‚Äôs law for electric forces. If \( \mathbf{r} \) is the position vector and \( c \) is a constant, then:

\[
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{c}{\|\mathbf{r}\|^3} \mathbf{r}
\]

This means the vector field‚Äôs magnitude decreases with the square of the distance from the origin, and the direction is along \( \mathbf{r} \).



## 2. üåü Gradient, Conservative Fields, Divergence, Curl, and Laplacian

Vector calculus introduces several key operators that describe how vector fields change in space.

#### Gradient (‚àáœï)

If \( \phi(x, y, z) \) is a scalar function, its **gradient** is a vector field defined as:

\[
\nabla \phi = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \mathbf{j} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} \mathbf{k}
\]

- The gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of \( \phi \).
- The magnitude of the gradient tells how steeply \( \phi \) increases.

The operator \( \nabla \) (called **del**) is a vector differential operator used to define gradient, divergence, and curl.

#### Conservative Vector Fields

A vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) is **conservative** if it can be expressed as the gradient of some scalar function \( \phi \):

\[
\mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi
\]

- The function \( \phi \) is called the **potential function**.
- Conservative fields have important properties, such as path independence of line integrals (work done depends only on start and end points).

#### Divergence (div)

The **divergence** of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} = f \mathbf{i} + g \mathbf{j} + h \mathbf{k} \) measures the net rate of "flow" out of a point:

\[
\text{div}(\mathbf{F}) = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial h}{\partial z}
\]

- If divergence is positive at a point, the field behaves like a source there.
- If negative, it behaves like a sink.

#### Curl (‚àá√óF)

The **curl** measures the rotation or swirling strength of a vector field:

\[
\text{curl}(\mathbf{F}) = \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
f & g & h
\end{vmatrix}
\]

- The curl is itself a vector field.
- It indicates the axis and magnitude of rotation at each point.

#### Laplacian (‚àá¬≤)

The **Laplacian** operator is the divergence of the gradient of a scalar function:

\[
\nabla^2 \phi = \nabla \cdot (\nabla \phi) = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial z^2}
\]

- The Laplacian appears in many physical equations, such as heat flow and wave equations.
- The equation \( \nabla^2 \phi = 0 \) is called **Laplace‚Äôs equation**, describing steady-state situations.



## 3. ‚û∞ Line Integrals: Measuring Along Curves

Line integrals extend the idea of integration to functions defined along curves in space.

#### Scalar Line Integrals

If \( f \) is a scalar function defined on a smooth curve \( C \) parameterized by \( \mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) \) for \( a \leq t \leq b \), the **line integral** of \( f \) along \( C \) is:

\[
\int_C f(x, y, z) \, ds = \int_a^b f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

- Here, \( ds \) represents an infinitesimal arc length along the curve.
- Intuitively, this integral sums the values of \( f \) weighted by the length of the curve.

**Interpretation:** If \( f \) is non-negative and defined on a curve in the plane, the line integral can represent the area of a "curtain" formed by extending vertical segments of height \( f(x,y) \) along the curve.

#### Vector Line Integrals

For a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) and a curve \( C \) parameterized by \( \mathbf{r}(t) \), the **line integral of \( \mathbf{F} \) along \( C \)** is:

\[
\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_a^b \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) \, dt
\]

- This integral measures the work done by the vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) along the path \( C \).
- The dot product \( \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} \) captures how much of the vector field is tangent to the curve.



## 4. üîÑ Independence of Path and Conservative Vector Fields

One of the most important properties of conservative vector fields is that the line integral (work done) is **independent of the path** taken between two points.

#### Work Done by a Force Field

If a particle moves along a curve \( C \) under a force field \( \mathbf{F} \), the work done is:

\[
W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
\]

#### Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals

If \( \mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi \) for some scalar potential \( \phi \), then the line integral depends only on the values of \( \phi \) at the endpoints:

\[
\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \phi(\mathbf{r}(b)) - \phi(\mathbf{r}(a))
\]

This means the work done by a conservative force field is path-independent.

#### Closed Curves and Simply Connected Regions

- A **closed curve** is one where the start and end points are the same.
- A **connected region** is one where any two points can be joined by a smooth curve inside the region.
- A **simply connected region** is a connected region with no holes, so every closed curve encloses only points inside the region.

#### Equivalence Theorem for Conservative Fields

For a vector field \( \mathbf{F} = f \mathbf{i} + g \mathbf{j} + h \mathbf{k} \) with continuous components on a connected open region \( D \), the following are equivalent:

- \( \mathbf{F} \) is conservative.
- The line integral of \( \mathbf{F} \) around every closed curve in \( D \) is zero.
- The line integral of \( \mathbf{F} \) between any two points in \( D \) is independent of the path.

#### Test for Conservativeness in 2D

For a vector field \( \mathbf{F} = f(x,y) \mathbf{i} + g(x,y) \mathbf{j} \) with continuous partial derivatives on a simply connected region \( D \), \( \mathbf{F} \) is conservative if and only if:

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}
\]

This condition ensures the existence of a potential function \( \phi \) such that \( \mathbf{F} = \nabla \phi \).



## 5. üßÆ Examples and Applications

#### Example 1: Line Integral of a Scalar Function

Evaluate:

\[
\int_C x^2 z \, ds
\]

where \( C \) is the helix parameterized by:

\[
x = \cos t, \quad y = 2t, \quad z = \sin t, \quad 0 \leq t \leq \pi
\]

- Compute \( ds = \sqrt{(-\sin t)^2 + (2)^2 + (\cos t)^2} dt = \sqrt{\sin^2 t + 4 + \cos^2 t} dt = \sqrt{1 + 4} dt = \sqrt{5} dt \).
- Substitute \( x, z \) into the integrand and integrate over \( t \).

#### Example 2: Vector Line Integral

Given \( \mathbf{F} = y \mathbf{i} + x \mathbf{j} \) and \( C \) is the top half of the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \) from \( (2,0) \) to \( (-2,0) \), evaluate:

\[
\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
\]

- Parametrize \( C \) as \( x = 2 \cos \theta, y = 2 \sin \theta, 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi \).
- Compute \( d\mathbf{r} = (-2 \sin \theta) \mathbf{i} + (2 \cos \theta) \mathbf{j} \, d\theta \).
- Substitute and integrate.

#### Example 3: Checking Conservativeness

Show that:

\[
\mathbf{F} = (e^x \sin y - y) \mathbf{i} + (e^x \cos y - x - 2) \mathbf{j}
\]

is conservative and find a potential function \( \phi \).

- Check if \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} \).
- Integrate \( f \) with respect to \( x \) or \( g \) with respect to \( y \) to find \( \phi \).



## Summary

Vector calculus provides powerful tools to analyze vector fields and their behavior in space. Understanding vector fields, gradient, divergence, curl, and line integrals is essential for applications in physics and engineering. The concept of conservative fields simplifies many problems by reducing path-dependent integrals to differences in potential functions.
