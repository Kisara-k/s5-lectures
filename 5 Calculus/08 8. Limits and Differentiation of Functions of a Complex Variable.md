Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized, and clear study note based on the lecture content you provided. The explanations are thorough and accessible, avoiding overly academic jargon, and include emojis for clarity in the main headings.



### 1. 🧮 Functions of a Complex Variable: Understanding the Basics

When we talk about functions of a complex variable, we are dealing with functions where the input and output are complex numbers. A complex number is usually written as \( z = x + iy \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers, and \( i \) is the imaginary unit with the property \( i^2 = -1 \).

#### What is a function of a complex variable?

A function \( f \) defined on a set \( S \) of complex numbers assigns to each complex number \( z \in S \) another complex number \( \omega \). We write this as:
\[
\omega = f(z).
\]
Here, \( S \) is called the **domain** of the function, and the value \( \omega \) is the **image** of \( z \) under \( f \).

#### Expressing complex functions in terms of real variables

Since \( z = x + iy \) and \( \omega = u + iv \), where \( u \) and \( v \) are real numbers, the function \( f \) can be split into two real-valued functions:
\[
f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y).
\]
This means the output depends on two real variables \( x \) and \( y \), and the function \( f \) can be thought of as a pair of real functions \( u \) and \( v \).

#### Using polar coordinates

Instead of Cartesian coordinates \( (x, y) \), we can use polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), where:
\[
z = r e^{i\theta}, \quad r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \quad \theta = \tan^{-1}(y/x).
\]
In this form, the function becomes:
\[
f(z) = u(r, \theta) + i v(r, \theta).
\]

#### Examples to illustrate

- **Example 1:** Write \( f(z) = z^3 + z + 1 \) in terms of \( u(x,y) \) and \( v(x,y) \).
- **Example 2:** Given \( f(z) = x^2 - y^2 - 2y + i(2x - 2xy) \), express \( f(z) \) in terms of \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \) (the complex conjugate of \( z \)).
- **Example 3:** Write \( f(z) = z + \overline{z} \) (for \( z \neq 0 \)) in polar form \( u(r, \theta) + i v(r, \theta) \).

#### Mapping and transformations

A function \( f \) can also be called a **mapping** or **transformation** because it "maps" points from the \( z \)-plane to the \( \omega \)-plane. Some common geometric transformations include:

- **Translation:** \( \omega = z + 1 \) shifts every point one unit to the right.
- **Rotation:** \( \omega = i z = r e^{i(\theta + \pi/2)} \) rotates every point by 90° counterclockwise.
- **Reflection:** \( \omega = \overline{z} = x - iy \) reflects points about the real axis.



### 2. 🔍 Limits of Complex Functions: Approaching Values

Limits help us understand the behavior of functions as the input approaches a particular point.

#### Limits in two real variables

For a real-valued function \( f(x,y) \), the limit as \( (x,y) \to (x_0,y_0) \) is \( L \) if for every small positive number \( \epsilon \), there exists a \( \delta \) such that whenever the distance between \( (x,y) \) and \( (x_0,y_0) \) is less than \( \delta \) (but not zero), the value \( f(x,y) \) is within \( \epsilon \) of \( L \).

Formally:
\[
\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y) = L \quad \text{if} \quad \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0: 0 < \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2} < \delta \implies |f(x,y) - L| < \epsilon.
\]

#### Limits in complex variables

For a complex function \( f(z) \), the limit as \( z \to z_0 \) is \( \omega_0 \) if for every \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that:
\[
0 < |z - z_0| < \delta \implies |f(z) - \omega_0| < \epsilon.
\]
This means \( f(z) \) can be made arbitrarily close to \( \omega_0 \) by choosing \( z \) sufficiently close to \( z_0 \), but not equal to \( z_0 \).

#### Important properties and examples

- **Uniqueness:** If a finite limit exists at \( z_0 \), it is unique.
- **Algebra of limits:** Limits behave nicely with addition, multiplication, and division (when the denominator limit is non-zero).
- **Composition:** The limit of a composition \( f(g(\omega)) \) can be found if the limits of \( f \) and \( g \) exist appropriately.

#### Examples

- **Example 4:** For \( f(z) = \frac{i z}{2} \) in the disk \( |z| < 1 \), show that \( \lim_{z \to 1} f(z) = \frac{i}{2} \).
- **Example 5:** For \( f(z) = \frac{z}{\overline{z}} \), the limit as \( z \to 0 \) does **not** exist because the value depends on the direction from which \( z \) approaches zero.



### 3. 🔄 Continuity of Complex Functions: Smooth Behavior

Continuity means the function behaves predictably near a point, without sudden jumps or breaks.

#### Definition of continuity at a point

A function \( f \) is **continuous** at \( z_0 \) if:

1. The limit \( \lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) \) exists.
2. The function value \( f(z_0) \) is defined.
3. The limit equals the function value:
\[
\lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = f(z_0).
\]

#### Key theorems about continuity

- The composition of continuous functions is continuous.
- If \( f \) is continuous and non-zero at \( z_0 \), then \( f(z) \neq 0 \) in some neighborhood around \( z_0 \).
- If \( f \) is continuous on a compact region (closed and bounded), then \( |f(z)| \) is bounded by some maximum value \( M \).



### 4. ✏️ Differentiation of Complex Functions: The Complex Derivative

Differentiation in complex analysis is similar to real calculus but has important differences due to the nature of complex numbers.

#### Definition of the complex derivative

The derivative of \( f \) at \( z_0 \) is defined as:
\[
f'(z_0) = \lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0},
\]
provided this limit exists.

If this limit exists, \( f \) is said to be **differentiable** at \( z_0 \).

#### Examples

- **Example 6:** For \( f(z) = z^2 \), the derivative at any \( z \) is \( f'(z) = 2z \).
- **Example 7:** For \( f(z) = \overline{z} \), the derivative does **not** exist anywhere.
- **Example 8:** For the real-valued function \( f(z) = |z|^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the derivative does not exist in the complex sense.

#### Important properties

- If \( f \) is differentiable at \( z_0 \), then \( f \) is continuous at \( z_0 \).
- Differentiation rules similar to real calculus hold:
  - Derivative of a constant is zero.
  - Derivative of \( c f(z) \) is \( c f'(z) \).
  - Power rule: \( \frac{d}{dz} z^n = n z^{n-1} \).
  - Sum rule: \( (f + g)' = f' + g' \).
  - Product rule: \( (fg)' = f g' + f' g \).
  - Quotient rule: \( \left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{g f' - f g'}{g^2} \), provided \( g(z) \neq 0 \).



### 5. 📐 Analytic Functions and the Cauchy-Riemann Equations

#### What does it mean for a function to be analytic?

A function \( f \) is **analytic** at \( z_0 \) if it is differentiable at every point in some neighborhood around \( z_0 \). If \( f \) is analytic everywhere in an open set \( G \), then \( f \) is analytic on \( G \).

Analytic functions are very important because they have many nice properties, such as being infinitely differentiable and having power series expansions.

#### The Cauchy-Riemann equations: a key test for differentiability

Suppose \( f(z) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y) \) and \( f'(z_0) \) exists. Then the partial derivatives of \( u \) and \( v \) must exist and satisfy the **Cauchy-Riemann equations** at \( (x_0, y_0) \):
\[
u_x = v_y, \quad u_y = -v_x,
\]
where subscripts denote partial derivatives.

Moreover, the derivative can be expressed as:
\[
f'(z_0) = u_x(x_0, y_0) + i v_x(x_0, y_0).
\]

#### Sufficient conditions for differentiability

If \( u \) and \( v \) have continuous first-order partial derivatives in a neighborhood of \( z_0 \) and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations there, then \( f \) is differentiable at \( z_0 \).

#### Corollary for analyticity

If \( u \) and \( v \) satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations throughout an open region \( G \) and have continuous partial derivatives, then \( f \) is analytic on \( G \).

#### Examples

- **Example 9a:** \( f(z) = e^z \) is analytic everywhere.
- **Example 9b:** \( f(z) = |z|^2 \) is not analytic anywhere because it does not satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations.



### 6. 🔄 Polar Form of the Cauchy-Riemann Equations

When working in polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), the Cauchy-Riemann equations take a slightly different form.

If \( f(z) = u(r, \theta) + i v(r, \theta) \) is defined near \( z_0 = r_0 e^{i \theta_0} \), and the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the polar form of the Cauchy-Riemann equations is:
\[
r u_r = v_\theta, \quad u_\theta = -r v_r,
\]
where subscripts denote partial derivatives with respect to \( r \) and \( \theta \).

The derivative at \( z_0 \) can be computed as:
\[
f'(z_0) = e^{-i \theta_0} (u_r + i v_r),
\]
evaluated at \( (r_0, \theta_0) \).



## Summary

- Functions of a complex variable map complex numbers to complex numbers and can be expressed in terms of real and imaginary parts.
- Limits and continuity in complex functions extend the ideas from real functions but require considering all directions in the complex plane.
- Differentiability in complex analysis is stricter than in real analysis and leads to the concept of analytic functions.
- The Cauchy-Riemann equations provide necessary and sufficient conditions for differentiability and analyticity.
- Polar coordinates offer an alternative way to express these conditions and compute derivatives.

This foundational understanding is crucial for further study in complex analysis, including contour integration, analytic continuation, and complex function theory.
