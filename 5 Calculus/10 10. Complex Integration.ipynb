       "\n",
       "Complex integration extends the idea of integration from real-valued functions to complex-valued functions. Instead of integrating over a real interval, we integrate functions whose inputs and outputs are complex numbers. This is fundamental in complex analysis and has many applications in physics and engineering.\n",

       "Suppose we have a complex-valued function $ f(t) = u(t) + iv(t) $, where $ u(t) $ and $ v(t) $ are real-valued functions of a real variable $ t $ defined on an interval $[a, b]$. Here, $ i $ is the imaginary unit with $ i^2 = -1 $.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Since $ u(t) $ and $ v(t) $ are real functions, if they are continuous on $[a, b]$, they are integrable in the usual real sense.\n",

       "P_n = \\{ z_0 = A, z_1, z_2, \\ldots, z_n = B \\}\n",

       "$$\n",
