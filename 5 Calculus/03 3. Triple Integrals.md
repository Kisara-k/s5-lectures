## 3. Triple Integrals

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on the lecture content you provided about **Triple Integrals**. The explanations are clear and thorough, aimed at helping you understand the concepts step-by-step without skipping any important details.



### 1. üì¶ What Are Triple Integrals?

Triple integrals extend the idea of single and double integrals into three dimensions. Instead of integrating over a line or a surface, triple integrals allow us to integrate over a **solid region** in three-dimensional space.

Imagine you have a solid object \( G \) in 3D space, and a function \( f(x, y, z) \) defined on this solid. The triple integral of \( f \) over \( G \) gives you a way to sum up values of \( f \) throughout the entire volume of \( G \).

#### How is a Triple Integral Defined?

To define the triple integral rigorously, we:

- Enclose the solid \( G \) inside a rectangular box.
- Divide this box into many small rectangular sub-boxes by slicing it with planes parallel to the coordinate planes (the \(xy\), \(yz\), and \(xz\) planes).
- Ignore any sub-boxes that lie outside the solid \( G \).
- Pick a sample point \((x_k^*, y_k^*, z_k^*)\) inside each remaining sub-box.
- Multiply the function value at that point, \( f(x_k^*, y_k^*, z_k^*) \), by the volume of the sub-box, \( \Delta V_k \).
- Sum all these products to get a Riemann sum:  
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*, y_k^*, z_k^*) \Delta V_k
  \]
- Take the limit as the number of sub-boxes \( n \to \infty \) and the size of each sub-box goes to zero. This limit, if it exists, is the **triple integral** of \( f \) over \( G \), denoted by:  
  \[
  \iiint_G f(x, y, z) \, dV
  \]

This process generalizes the idea of summing up infinitesimal contributions over a volume.



### 2. üîë Key Properties of Triple Integrals

Triple integrals share many properties similar to single and double integrals, which make them easier to work with:

- **Linearity:**  
  Multiplying the function by a constant \( c \) pulls the constant out of the integral:  
  \[
  \iiint_G c f(x, y, z) \, dV = c \iiint_G f(x, y, z) \, dV
  \]

- **Additivity:**  
  The integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals:  
  \[
  \iiint_G [f(x, y, z) + g(x, y, z)] \, dV = \iiint_G f(x, y, z) \, dV + \iiint_G g(x, y, z) \, dV
  \]

- **Subtraction:**  
  Similarly, the integral of a difference is the difference of the integrals:  
  \[
  \iiint_G [f(x, y, z) - g(x, y, z)] \, dV = \iiint_G f(x, y, z) \, dV - \iiint_G g(x, y, z) \, dV
  \]

- **Additivity over regions:**  
  If the solid \( G \) is split into two parts \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \), then:  
  \[
  \iiint_G f(x, y, z) \, dV = \iiint_{G_1} f(x, y, z) \, dV + \iiint_{G_2} f(x, y, z) \, dV
  \]

These properties allow us to break down complicated integrals into simpler parts.



### 3. üîÑ Fubini‚Äôs Theorem for Triple Integrals

Fubini‚Äôs theorem is a powerful tool that lets us compute triple integrals as iterated integrals ‚Äî that is, as repeated single integrals.

#### What does Fubini‚Äôs Theorem say?

If \( G \) is a **rectangular box** defined by:
\[
a \leq x \leq b, \quad c \leq y \leq d, \quad k \leq z \leq l
\]
and \( f \) is continuous on \( G \), then the triple integral can be computed as:
\[
\iiint_G f(x, y, z) \, dV = \int_a^b \int_c^d \int_k^l f(x, y, z) \, dz \, dy \, dx
\]

Moreover, the order of integration can be changed freely among \( x, y, z \), giving six possible orders of integration. This flexibility is very useful for simplifying calculations.



### 4. üèûÔ∏è Triple Integrals Over More General Regions

Not all solids are simple boxes. Often, the solid \( G \) is bounded by curved surfaces rather than flat planes.

#### Simple \( xy \)-solid regions

Suppose the solid \( G \) lies between two surfaces:
\[
z = u(x, y) \quad \text{(lower surface)}, \quad z = v(x, y) \quad \text{(upper surface)}
\]
and the projection of \( G \) onto the \( xy \)-plane is a region \( R \).

If \( u \) and \( v \) are continuous and \( u(x, y) \leq v(x, y) \) for all \((x, y) \in R\), then \( G \) is called a **simple \( xy \)-solid**.

#### How to compute the triple integral over such a region?

The triple integral becomes:
\[
\iiint_G f(x, y, z) \, dV = \iint_R \left( \int_{u(x,y)}^{v(x,y)} f(x, y, z) \, dz \right) dA
\]
where \( dA \) is the area element in the \( xy \)-plane.

#### Types of projections \( R \):

- **Vertically simple (Type I):**  
  For each fixed \( x \) in \([a, b]\), \( y \) varies between two functions \( g_1(x) \) and \( g_2(x) \). Then:
  \[
  \iiint_G f \, dV = \int_a^b \int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} \int_{u(x,y)}^{v(x,y)} f(x, y, z) \, dz \, dy \, dx
  \]

- **Horizontally simple (Type II):**  
  For each fixed \( y \) in \([c, d]\), \( x \) varies between two functions \( h_1(y) \) and \( h_2(y) \). Then:
  \[
  \iiint_G f \, dV = \int_c^d \int_{h_1(y)}^{h_2(y)} \int_{u(x,y)}^{v(x,y)} f(x, y, z) \, dz \, dx \, dy
  \]

#### Remark:

Similar approaches apply if the projection is onto the \( yz \)-plane or the \( zx \)-plane, just changing the order of integration accordingly.



### 5. üîÑ Triple Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates

Sometimes, the geometry of the solid \( G \) is easier to describe using **cylindrical coordinates** instead of Cartesian coordinates.

#### What are cylindrical coordinates?

Cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) relate to Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\) by:
\[
x = r \cos \theta, \quad y = r \sin \theta, \quad z = z
\]
where:
- \( r \) is the distance from the \( z \)-axis,
- \( \theta \) is the angle in the \( xy \)-plane from the positive \( x \)-axis,
- \( z \) is the height, same as in Cartesian.

#### How do triple integrals look in cylindrical coordinates?

The volume element \( dV \) in cylindrical coordinates is:
\[
dV = r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]
The extra factor \( r \) accounts for the "stretching" of the area element in polar coordinates.

#### Definition and theorem:

If \( G \) is bounded above and below by surfaces:
\[
z = v(r, \theta) \quad \text{and} \quad z = u(r, \theta)
\]
and the projection of \( G \) onto the \( xy \)-plane is a simple polar region \( R \), then:
\[
\iiint_G f(r, \theta, z) \, dV = \iint_R \left( \int_{u(r,\theta)}^{v(r,\theta)} f(r, \theta, z) \, dz \right) r \, dr \, d\theta
\]

#### Expressing the triple integral as an iterated integral:
\[
\iiint_G f(r, \theta, z) \, dV = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \int_{r_1(\theta)}^{r_2(\theta)} \int_{u(r,\theta)}^{v(r,\theta)} f(r, \theta, z) \, r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

#### Converting from Cartesian to cylindrical coordinates:

A triple integral in Cartesian coordinates can be rewritten as:
\[
\iiint_G f(x, y, z) \, dV = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \int_{r_1(\theta)}^{r_2(\theta)} \int_{z_1(r,\theta)}^{z_2(r,\theta)} f(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta, z) \, r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]



### 6. üßÆ Examples to Illustrate Triple Integrals

#### Example 1: Evaluate a triple integral over a box

Evaluate:
\[
\iiint_B z^2 y e^x \, dV
\]
where \( B \) is the box:
\[
0 \leq x \leq 1, \quad 1 \leq y \leq 2, \quad -1 \leq z \leq 1
\]

**Approach:**

- Since \( B \) is a rectangular box, use Fubini‚Äôs theorem.
- Write the integral as iterated integrals:
\[
\int_0^1 \int_1^2 \int_{-1}^1 z^2 y e^x \, dz \, dy \, dx
\]
- Integrate step-by-step with respect to \( z \), then \( y \), then \( x \).



#### Example 2: Volume of a solid bounded by a cylinder and a plane

Find the volume of the solid in the first octant bounded by:
- Cylinder: \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \)
- Plane: \( 2y + z = 4 \)

**Approach:**

- The first octant means \( x, y, z \geq 0 \).
- Express the region in terms of \( x, y, z \).
- Use triple integrals with appropriate limits.
- Possibly convert to cylindrical coordinates for easier integration.



#### Example 3: Volume of a tetrahedron

Find the volume of the tetrahedron bounded by:
- Plane: \( 2x + y + 3z = 6 \)
- Coordinate planes: \( x=0, y=0, z=0 \)

**Approach:**

- The tetrahedron lies in the first octant.
- Express \( z \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
z = \frac{6 - 2x - y}{3}
\]
- Set up the triple integral with limits for \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).
- Integrate step-by-step.



#### Example 4: Volume bounded by a paraboloid and a plane

Find the volume of the solid bounded below by:
\[
z = x^2 + y^2
\]
and above by:
\[
2x + z = 3
\]

**Approach:**

- Express \( z \) from the plane:
\[
z = 3 - 2x
\]
- The solid lies between the paraboloid and the plane.
- Determine the projection region in the \( xy \)-plane.
- Set up the triple integral accordingly.



#### Example 5: Triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates

Find the volume of the solid in the first octant bounded by:
- Cylinder: \( x^2 + y^2 = 2y \)
- Half-cone: \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)
- \( xy \)-plane: \( z=0 \)

**Approach:**

- Convert the cylinder equation to cylindrical coordinates:
\[
r^2 = 2r \sin \theta \implies r = 2 \sin \theta
\]
- The half-cone is \( z = r \).
- The volume integral becomes:
\[
\int_{\theta=0}^{\pi/2} \int_{r=0}^{2 \sin \theta} \int_{z=0}^r r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]
- Integrate step-by-step.



### Summary

Triple integrals allow us to integrate functions over three-dimensional solids. They are defined as limits of sums over small volume elements and can be computed using iterated integrals thanks to Fubini‚Äôs theorem. For solids bounded by curved surfaces, we use projections onto coordinate planes and integrate accordingly. Cylindrical coordinates are especially useful when the solid has circular symmetry.

Understanding the setup of limits and the order of integration is crucial for solving triple integrals effectively.

- D is true; choice of projection affects integration order and limits.  
- A is false; projection need not be a rectangle.  
- C is false; projection onto \( zx \)-plane can be useful.



#### 11. In the triple integral \(\iiint_G z^2 y e^x \, dV\) over the box \( 0 \leq x \leq 1, 1 \leq y \leq 2, -1 \leq z \leq 1 \), which of the following is true?

**Correct answers:** B, C, D  
**Explanation:**  
- B is true; triple integral must be evaluated as iterated integral.  
- C is true; the function is separable as a product of functions of \( x, y, z \).  
- D is true; integrating with respect to \( z \) first is often simplest.  
- A is false; the integral cannot be separated into a product of three single integrals because the limits are independent but the function is separable, so the integral can be separated into a product of integrals.

*Note:* Actually, since the limits are constants and the function is separable, the integral **can** be separated into the product of three single integrals. So A is also correct.

**Correction:** A is also correct.



#### 12. Which of the following solids is best described using cylindrical coordinates?

**Correct answers:** B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- B is correct; cylinders are naturally described in cylindrical coordinates.  
- D is correct; paraboloids symmetric about \( z \)-axis fit well in cylindrical coordinates.  
- A and C are better described in Cartesian coordinates.



#### 13. When converting a triple integral from Cartesian to cylindrical coordinates, which of the following substitutions is correct?

**Correct answer:** A  
**Explanation:**  
- A is the standard conversion from Cartesian to cylindrical coordinates.  
- B, C, and D are incorrect substitutions.



#### 14. Which of the following statements about the limits of integration in triple integrals is false?

**Correct answer:** D  
**Explanation:**  
- D is false because the innermost integral limits often depend on outer variables.  
- A, B, and C are true statements about limits.



#### 15. Consider the solid bounded below by the paraboloid \( z = x^2 + y^2 \) and above by the plane \( 2x + z = 3 \). Which of the following is true?

**Correct answers:** A, B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- A is true; projection onto \( xy \)-plane is bounded by a curve.  
- B is true; \( z \) varies between paraboloid and plane.  
- D is true; \( dz \) is the innermost integral.  
- C is false; \( x \) and \( y \) limits depend on the projection region, not constants.



#### 16. Which of the following statements about the factor \( r \) in cylindrical coordinates is true?

**Correct answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:**  
- A and B are true; \( r \) accounts for area scaling in polar coordinates and appears in volume element.  
- C is false; \( r \) cannot be ignored.  
- D is false; \( r \) is not the radius in spherical coordinates.



#### 17. When evaluating the triple integral of a function over a solid region bounded by \( x^2 + y^2 = 2y \), the half-cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), and the \( xy \)-plane, which coordinate system is most appropriate?

**Correct answer:** B  
**Explanation:**  
- Cylindrical coordinates simplify the description of cylinders and cones symmetric about the \( z \)-axis.  
- Cartesian and spherical are less convenient here.  
- Polar coordinates alone are 2D, not suitable for triple integrals.



#### 18. Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the triple integral \(\iiint_G f(x,y,z) \, dV\)?

**Correct answers:** B, D  
**Explanation:**  
- B is true; if \( f \) is density, the integral gives total mass.  
- D is true; the integral equals average value times volume.  
- A is false; triple integrals do not represent volume under a surface in 3D.  
- C is false; surface area is not computed by triple integrals.



#### 19. Which of the following statements about iterated integrals is true?

**Correct answers:** A, B, C  
**Explanation:**  
- A is true for continuous functions by Fubini‚Äôs theorem.  
- B is true; changing order can simplify calculations.  
- C is true; limits must be adjusted when changing order.  
- D is false; iterated integrals apply to more general regions than just boxes.



#### 20. When the projection of a solid \( G \) is onto the \( yz \)-plane, which of the following is true?

**Correct answers:** A, B  
**Explanation:**  
- A is true; \( x \) can be the innermost variable integrated over limits depending on \( y, z \).  
- B is true; limits for \( y \) and \( z \) come from the projection region.  
- C is false; order of integration is flexible.  
- D is false; projection onto \( yz \)-plane is relevant for setting limits.
