Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized, and clear study note based on the lecture content you provided. I have expanded explanations, clarified key concepts, and structured the note with numbered main headings and emojis for clarity.



## 1. 📘 Functions of a Complex Variable

When we talk about functions of a complex variable, we are dealing with functions where the input and output are complex numbers. A complex number is usually written as \( z = x + iy \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers, and \( i \) is the imaginary unit with the property \( i^2 = -1 \).

**Definition:**  
A function \( f \) defined on a set \( S \) of complex numbers assigns to each \( z \in S \) a complex number \( \omega \). We write this as:  
\[
\omega = f(z)
\]
where \( \omega = u + iv \), with \( u \) and \( v \) being real numbers that depend on \( x \) and \( y \). This means the function \( f \) can be thought of as two real-valued functions combined:
\[
f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y)
\]
Here, \( u(x,y) \) and \( v(x,y) \) represent the real and imaginary parts of \( f(z) \), respectively.

Alternatively, if we use polar coordinates, where \( z = r e^{i\theta} \) (with \( r \geq 0 \) and \( \theta \) the angle), then:
\[
f(z) = u(r, \theta) + i v(r, \theta)
\]

**Examples:**

- For \( f(z) = z^3 + z + 1 \), you can expand \( z = x + iy \) and rewrite \( f(z) \) in terms of \( u(x,y) \) and \( v(x,y) \).
- Given \( f(z) = x^2 - y^2 - 2y + i(2x - 2xy) \), you can express \( f(z) \) purely in terms of \( z \) and its conjugate \( \bar{z} \) using the identities:
  \[
  x = \frac{z + \bar{z}}{2}, \quad y = \frac{z - \bar{z}}{2i}
  \]
- For \( f(z) = z + \bar{z} \) (with \( z \neq 0 \)), express it in polar form \( u(r, \theta) + i v(r, \theta) \).

**Mapping and Transformations:**

A function \( f \) is often called a *mapping* or *transformation* because it "maps" points from the \( z \)-plane (domain) to points in the \( \omega \)-plane (range). The image of a point \( z \) is \( \omega = f(z) \). The set of all images of points in a subset \( T \subseteq S \) is called the *image* of \( T \). The image of the entire domain \( S \) is called the *range* of \( f \).

Some mappings correspond to geometric transformations:

- **Translation:** \( \omega = z + 1 \) shifts every point one unit to the right.
- **Rotation:** \( \omega = i z = r e^{i(\theta + \pi/2)} \) rotates every point by 90° counterclockwise.
- **Reflection:** \( \omega = \bar{z} = x - iy \) reflects points about the real axis.



## 2. 🔍 Limits of Complex Functions

Limits describe the behavior of a function as the input approaches a particular point.

**Limits in Real Variables:**

For a real-valued function \( f(x,y) \), the limit as \( (x,y) \to (x_0,y_0) \) is \( L \) if for every small positive number \( \epsilon \), there exists a \( \delta \) such that whenever the distance between \( (x,y) \) and \( (x_0,y_0) \) is less than \( \delta \) (but not zero), the value \( f(x,y) \) is within \( \epsilon \) of \( L \).

Formally:
\[
\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y) = L
\]
means:
\[
\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } 0 < \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2} < \delta \implies |f(x,y) - L| < \epsilon
\]

**Limits in Complex Variables:**

For a complex function \( f(z) \), the limit as \( z \to z_0 \) is \( \omega_0 \) if for every \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists \( \delta > 0 \) such that whenever \( 0 < |z - z_0| < \delta \), we have:
\[
|f(z) - \omega_0| < \epsilon
\]

This means the function values \( f(z) \) get arbitrarily close to \( \omega_0 \) as \( z \) approaches \( z_0 \), but \( z \neq z_0 \).

**Examples:**

- If \( f(z) = \frac{i z}{2} \) in the disk \( |z| < 1 \), then:
\[
\lim_{z \to 1} f(z) = \frac{i}{2}
\]
- For \( f(z) = \frac{z}{\bar{z}} \), the limit as \( z \to 0 \) does *not* exist because the value depends on the direction from which \( z \) approaches zero.

**Important Theorems:**

- **Uniqueness of Limits:** If a finite limit exists at a point, it is unique.
- **Limit Laws:** Limits behave nicely under addition, multiplication, and division (when the denominator limit is non-zero).
- **Composition of Limits:** If \( \lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = L \) and \( \lim_{\omega \to \omega_0} g(\omega) = z_0 \), then:
\[
\lim_{\omega \to \omega_0} f(g(\omega)) = L
\]
- **Limits of Complex Functions in Terms of Real Parts:**  
If \( f(z) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y) \), then:
\[
\lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = \omega_0 = u_0 + i v_0
\]
if and only if:
\[
\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} u(x,y) = u_0 \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} v(x,y) = v_0
\]



## 3. 🔄 Continuity of Complex Functions

Continuity means the function behaves "smoothly" at a point, without sudden jumps or breaks.

**Definition:**

A function \( f \) is continuous at \( z_0 \) if:

1. The limit \( \lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) \) exists.
2. The function value \( f(z_0) \) is defined.
3. The limit equals the function value:
\[
\lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = f(z_0)
\]

**Key Properties:**

- The composition of continuous functions is continuous.
- If \( f \) is continuous and non-zero at \( z_0 \), then \( f(z) \neq 0 \) in some neighborhood around \( z_0 \).
- If \( f \) is continuous on a compact region (closed and bounded), then \( |f(z)| \) is bounded by some real number \( M \) on that region.



## 4. ✏️ Differentiation of Complex Functions

Differentiation in complex analysis is similar in spirit to real differentiation but has stricter conditions.

**Definition:**

The derivative of \( f \) at \( z_0 \) is:
\[
f'(z_0) = \lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0}
\]
if this limit exists.

If \( f'(z_0) \) exists, \( f \) is said to be *differentiable* at \( z_0 \).

**Examples:**

- For \( f(z) = z^2 \), the derivative at any \( z \) is:
\[
f'(z) = 2z
\]
- For \( f(z) = \bar{z} \), the derivative does *not* exist anywhere.
- For \( f(z) = |z|^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the derivative does not exist as a complex derivative.

**Important Theorems:**

- If \( f \) is differentiable at \( z_0 \), then \( f \) is continuous at \( z_0 \).
- Differentiation rules hold similarly to real calculus:
  - Derivative of a constant is zero.
  - Derivative of \( c f(z) \) is \( c f'(z) \).
  - Power rule: \( \frac{d}{dz} z^n = n z^{n-1} \) for positive integers \( n \).
  - Sum rule: \( (f + g)' = f' + g' \).
  - Product rule: \( (fg)' = f g' + f' g \).
  - Quotient rule: \( \left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{g f' - f g'}{g^2} \), provided \( g(z) \neq 0 \).



## 5. 🧩 Analytic Functions and the Cauchy-Riemann Equations

A function is *analytic* if it is differentiable not just at a point but in a whole neighborhood around that point.

**Definition:**

- \( f \) is *analytic* at \( z_0 \) if it has a derivative at every point in some neighborhood of \( z_0 \).
- \( f \) is analytic on an open set \( G \) if it is differentiable everywhere in \( G \).

**Remark:**

If \( f \) is analytic at \( z_0 \), then \( f' \) is continuous near \( z_0 \). This means analytic functions are very "nice" and smooth.

**Cauchy-Riemann Equations:**

Suppose:
\[
f(z) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)
\]
and \( f'(z_0) \) exists at \( z_0 = x_0 + i y_0 \). Then the partial derivatives of \( u \) and \( v \) must exist and satisfy:
\[
u_x = v_y, \quad u_y = -v_x
\]
at \( (x_0, y_0) \).

Moreover, the derivative can be expressed as:
\[
f'(z_0) = u_x + i v_x
\]

**Sufficient Conditions for Differentiability:**

If \( u \) and \( v \) have continuous first-order partial derivatives in a neighborhood of \( z_0 \) and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations at \( z_0 \), then \( f'(z_0) \) exists.

**Corollary:**

If \( u \) and \( v \) are continuously differentiable on an open region \( G \), then \( f \) is analytic on \( G \) if and only if the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold everywhere on \( G \).

**Examples:**

- \( f(z) = e^z \) is analytic everywhere.
- \( f(z) = |z|^2 \) is not analytic anywhere except possibly at isolated points.



## 6. 🔄 Polar Form of the Cauchy-Riemann Equations

When working in polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), the Cauchy-Riemann equations take a slightly different form.

If:
\[
f(z) = u(r, \theta) + i v(r, \theta)
\]
and the partial derivatives \( u_r, u_\theta, v_r, v_\theta \) exist and are continuous near \( (r_0, \theta_0) \), then the Cauchy-Riemann equations become:
\[
r u_r = v_\theta, \quad u_\theta = -r v_r
\]

The derivative at \( z_0 = r_0 e^{i \theta_0} \) is:
\[
f'(z_0) = e^{-i \theta_0} (u_r + i v_r)
\]



## Summary

- Complex functions map complex numbers to complex numbers and can be expressed in terms of real and imaginary parts.
- Limits and continuity in complex functions extend the ideas from real functions but require considering all directions in the complex plane.
- Differentiability in complex analysis is stricter than in real analysis and leads to the concept of analytic functions.
- The Cauchy-Riemann equations are necessary (and under some conditions sufficient) for differentiability and analyticity.
- Analytic functions are smooth and have continuous derivatives.
- Polar coordinates provide an alternative way to express and analyze complex functions and their derivatives.

- It also implies the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold at \( z_0 \) (B).  
- Analyticity (C) requires differentiability in a neighborhood, not just at a point.  
- Continuity in a neighborhood (D) is not guaranteed by differentiability at a single point.



#### 17. The inverse image of a point \( \omega_0 \) under a function \( f \) is:  
**Correct:** A  
**Explanation:**  
The inverse image is the set of all \( z \) such that \( f(z) = \omega_0 \).



#### 18. Which of the following functions is analytic on the entire complex plane?  
**Correct:** A, D  
**Explanation:**  
- \( e^z \) and polynomials like \( z^3 + z + 1 \) are entire (analytic everywhere).  
- \( |z| \) and \( \bar{z} \) are not analytic anywhere except trivial points.



#### 19. The limit \( \lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = \omega_0 \) means:  
**Correct:** A, C  
**Explanation:**  
- The formal definition of limit is (A).  
- The intuitive meaning is (C).  
- B is false because the limit does not require \( f(z_0) = \omega_0 \).  
- D is about continuity, which requires the limit to equal the function value.



#### 20. Which of the following statements about the composition of limits is true?  
**Correct:** A, C, D  
**Explanation:**  
- (A) is the theorem about composition of limits.  
- (C) is true because the limit depends on behavior near \( \omega_0 \).  
- (D) is true; even if individual limits exist, the composition limit may fail.  
- (B) is false; existence of individual limits does not guarantee the composition limit exists.
