       "\n",
       "Residue theory is a powerful tool in complex analysis that helps us evaluate complex integrals, especially those involving functions with singularities. To understand residue theory, we first need to understand what singularities are and how they are classified.\n",

       "##### What is a Singular Point?\n",
       "\n",
       "A **singular point** (or singularity) of a complex function $ f(z) $ is a point $ \\alpha $ where the function is **not analytic** (not differentiable in the complex sense), but in every neighborhood around $ \\alpha $, there are points where $ f $ *is* analytic. This means the function misbehaves only at $ \\alpha $, but behaves nicely nearby.\n",

       "##### Isolated Singularities\n",

       "\n",
       "**Correct:** A, C  \n",
       "**Explanation:** An isolated singularity means $ f $ is not analytic at $ \\alpha $, but analytic in some punctured neighborhood around $ \\alpha $ (A). Also, $ f $ is analytic everywhere except at $ \\alpha $ (C). B and D are incorrect because B says $ f $ is analytic at $ \\alpha $ (contradiction), and D says no neighborhood contains analytic points (not isolated).\n",

       "\n",
       "**Correct:** A  \n",
       "**Explanation:** A removable singularity means no negative powers in the Laurent series, so $ a_k = 0 $ for all $ k < 0 $. B, C, and D describe poles or essential singularities.\n",

       "**Explanation:** For a pole of order 3, $ a_{-3} \\neq 0 $ and all $ a_k = 0 $ for $ k < -3 $. The residue $ a_{-1} $ may or may not be zero, so D is not necessarily true.\n",

       "\n",
       "##### 8. If $ f $ has a pole of order 4 at $ z = \\alpha $, and $ g $ has a pole of order 2 at $ z = \\alpha $, what is the order of the pole of $ h(z) = f(z) g(z) $ at $ \\alpha $?\n",

       "**Correct:** A, D  \n",
       "**Explanation:** $ \\frac{1}{z} $ and $ \\frac{e^z}{z} $ have simple poles at zero. $ \\frac{1}{z^2} $ has a pole of order 2, and $ \\frac{\\sin z}{z} $ has a removable singularity at zero.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Correct:** A, B  \n",
       "**Explanation:** For $ n=1 $, residue is 1. For $ n > 1 $, residue is zero because the Laurent series has no $ (z-\\alpha)^{-1} $ term.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Correct:** A  \n",

       "\n",
       "**Correct:** A, D  \n",
       "**Explanation:** $ \\tan z $ has zeros at $ n \\pi $, but $ f $ has a pole at zero due to division by $ z $. Poles of $ \\tan z $ are at $ (n + \\frac{1}{2}) \\pi $.\n",
