## Study Notes: Stokes' Theorem and Divergence Theorem



### 1. üåä Stokes' Theorem: Connecting Line Integrals and Surface Integrals

#### Introduction to Stokes' Theorem

Stokes' Theorem is a fundamental result in vector calculus that creates a powerful link between two types of integrals: the **line integral** of a vector field around a closed curve and the **surface integral** of the curl of that vector field over the surface bounded by the curve. This theorem generalizes Green‚Äôs Theorem from the plane to surfaces in three-dimensional space.

#### What Does Stokes' Theorem Say?

Suppose you have:

- A **surface** \( \sigma \) that is smooth or piecewise smooth, oriented, and bounded by a simple, closed curve \( C \).
- A vector field \( \mathbf{F}(x,y,z) = f(x,y,z)\mathbf{i} + g(x,y,z)\mathbf{j} + h(x,y,z)\mathbf{k} \) whose components are continuous and have continuous first partial derivatives in an open region containing \( \sigma \).
- A unit normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \) defined on the surface \( \sigma \), consistent with the orientation of \( C \).

Then, Stokes' Theorem states:

\[
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_\sigma (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

In words:  
**The circulation of the vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) around the boundary curve \( C \) equals the flux of the curl of \( \mathbf{F} \) through the surface \( \sigma \).**

#### Breaking Down the Terms

- **Line integral \( \oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} \)**: Measures the total "work" done by the vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) along the closed curve \( C \).
- **Curl \( \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \)**: A vector field that measures the rotation or swirling strength of \( \mathbf{F} \) at each point.
- **Surface integral \( \iint_\sigma (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS \)**: Measures how much the curl of \( \mathbf{F} \) "flows" through the surface \( \sigma \).

#### Intuition

Imagine a tiny paddle wheel placed on the surface \( \sigma \). The curl at a point tells you how strongly the wheel would spin due to the vector field \( \mathbf{F} \). Stokes' Theorem says that the total spinning effect inside the surface (integrated curl) equals the total circulation around the boundary curve.



#### Examples to Illustrate Stokes' Theorem

**Example 1:**  
Evaluate the line integral

\[
\oint_C (2y^2 \, dx + z \, dy + x \, dz)
\]

where \( C \) is the curve formed by the intersection of the plane \( x + z = 1 \) and the ellipsoid \( x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = 1 \), oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above.

- Here, instead of directly computing the line integral, you can use Stokes' Theorem to convert it into a surface integral of the curl of the vector field over the surface bounded by \( C \).
- This often simplifies the calculation, especially when the surface is easier to parametrize or the curl is simpler.

**Example 2:**  
Evaluate the surface integral

\[
\iint_\sigma (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

where \( \mathbf{F} = x \mathbf{i} + y^2 \mathbf{j} + z e^{xy} \mathbf{k} \) and \( \sigma \) is the part of the surface \( z = 1 - x^2 - 2y^2 \) with \( z \geq 0 \).

- Here, you might compute the curl of \( \mathbf{F} \), find the unit normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \), and then evaluate the surface integral directly.



#### Relationship to Green's Theorem

Green's Theorem is a special case of Stokes' Theorem applied to a flat surface in the plane. If the vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) has zero \( k \)-component (i.e., \( \mathbf{F}(x,y) = f(x,y)\mathbf{i} + g(x,y)\mathbf{j} + 0\mathbf{k} \)) and the surface \( \sigma \) lies in the \( xy \)-plane, then Stokes' Theorem reduces to Green's Theorem.

This means that Stokes' Theorem can be seen as a generalization of Green's Theorem to curved surfaces in three dimensions.



### 2. üå¨Ô∏è Divergence Theorem: Relating Flux Through a Surface to Volume Integral

#### Introduction to the Divergence Theorem

The Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem, is another cornerstone of vector calculus. It connects the **flux** of a vector field through a closed surface to the **divergence** of the vector field inside the volume bounded by that surface.

#### Statement of the Divergence Theorem

Let:

- \( \sigma \) be a smooth, closed, orientable surface enclosing a solid region \( R \) in three-dimensional space.
- \( \mathbf{F} \) be a vector field with continuous components and continuous partial derivatives on an open set containing \( R \).
- \( \mathbf{n} \) be the outward-pointing unit normal vector on the surface \( \sigma \).

Then,

\[
\iint_\sigma \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS = \iiint_R \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dV
\]

In words:  
**The total flux of \( \mathbf{F} \) outward through the closed surface \( \sigma \) equals the integral of the divergence of \( \mathbf{F} \) over the volume \( R \) enclosed by \( \sigma \).**

#### Understanding the Terms

- **Flux \( \iint_\sigma \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS \)**: Measures how much of the vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) "flows out" through the surface \( \sigma \).
- **Divergence \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \)**: A scalar function that measures the "source strength" or how much \( \mathbf{F} \) is expanding or compressing at each point inside the volume.
- **Volume integral \( \iiint_R \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dV \)**: Adds up the divergence over the entire volume \( R \).

#### Intuition

Imagine \( \mathbf{F} \) represents the velocity field of a fluid. The divergence at a point tells you whether fluid is being created (positive divergence) or destroyed (negative divergence) there. The Divergence Theorem says that the total fluid flowing out of the volume equals the sum of all sources inside the volume.



#### Examples to Illustrate the Divergence Theorem

**Example 3:**  
Evaluate the flux integral

\[
\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

where \( \mathbf{F} = x^2 \mathbf{i} + xy \mathbf{j} + x^3 y^3 \mathbf{k} \) and \( S \) is the surface of the tetrahedron bounded by the plane \( x + y + z = 1 \) and the coordinate planes, with outward normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \).

- Instead of computing the flux directly over the complicated tetrahedron surface, use the Divergence Theorem to convert it into a volume integral of the divergence over the tetrahedron.

**Example 4:**  
Evaluate the flux integral

\[
\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

where \( \mathbf{F} = xy \mathbf{i} - z^2 \mathbf{k} \) and \( S \) is the upper five faces of the unit cube \([0,1]^3\).

- Here, since the surface is not closed (missing the bottom face), you might need to consider the flux through the missing face or use other methods.



#### Divergence as Flux Density: A Deeper Look

The divergence at a point \( P_0 \) can be interpreted as the **flux density** or the rate at which the vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) is "flowing out" per unit volume near \( P_0 \).

- Consider a very small spherical region \( G \) centered at \( P_0 \) with volume \( \text{vol}(G) \) and surface \( \sigma(G) \).
- The flux of \( \mathbf{F} \) across \( \sigma(G) \) is

\[
\phi(G) = \iint_{\sigma(G)} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS
\]

- If \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \) is continuous near \( P_0 \), then \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \) is approximately constant on \( G \), so

\[
\phi(G) \approx (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F})(P_0) \times \text{vol}(G)
\]

- Taking the limit as the volume shrinks to zero,

\[
(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F})(P_0) = \lim_{\text{vol}(G) \to 0} \frac{\phi(G)}{\text{vol}(G)}
\]

This means the divergence at \( P_0 \) is the **limit of the outward flux per unit volume** as the volume shrinks to the point.



## Summary

- **Stokes' Theorem** relates the circulation of a vector field around a closed curve to the flux of its curl through the surface bounded by that curve.
- **Divergence Theorem** relates the total flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the integral of its divergence over the volume enclosed by the surface.
- Both theorems provide powerful tools to convert difficult integrals into easier ones by changing the domain of integration (from curves to surfaces or from surfaces to volumes).
- The curl measures local rotation of a vector field, while divergence measures local expansion or compression.
- These theorems have deep physical interpretations, especially in fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.
