       "### 1. üìè Arc Length: Measuring the Length of a Curve\n",
       "\n",
       "When we talk about the length of a curve in three-dimensional space (‚Ñù¬≥), we want a way to measure how long the curve is, much like measuring the length of a piece of string. This is called the **arc length**.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### What is a Curve?\n",
       "\n",
       "A curve can be represented by a vector-valued function $\\mathbf{r}(t)$, where $t$ is a parameter that varies over an interval $[a, b]$. The function $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ outputs points in 3D space, tracing out the curve as $t$ changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Defining Arc Length\n",
       "\n",
       "To find the length of the curve between $t = a$ and $t = b$, we start by dividing the interval $[a, b]$ into smaller parts:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Let $P = \\{t_0, t_1, ..., t_n\\}$ be a partition of $[a, b]$, where $a = t_0 < t_1 < ... < t_n = b$.\n",
       "- For each subinterval $[t_{k-1}, t_k]$, we look at the straight-line distance between the points $\\mathbf{r}(t_{k-1})$ and $\\mathbf{r}(t_k)$.\n",
       "- Summing these distances gives an approximation of the curve length:\n",
       "  $$\n",
       "  s(\\mathbf{r}, P) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\|\\mathbf{r}(t_k) - \\mathbf{r}(t_{k-1})\\|\n",
       "  $$\n",
       "- The **arc length** $s(\\mathbf{r})$ is the supremum (the least upper bound) of these sums over all possible partitions $P$:\n",
       "  $$\n",
       "  s(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sup \\{ s(\\mathbf{r}, P) \\mid P \\text{ is a partition of } [a,b] \\}\n",
       "  $$\n",
       "\n",
       "If this supremum is a finite real number, the curve is called **rectifiable**.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Important Theorem: Arc Length Integral\n",
       "\n",
       "If the curve $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is continuously differentiable (denoted $\\mathbf{r} \\in C^1$), then the curve is rectifiable, and the arc length can be computed exactly by an integral:\n",
       "$$\n",
       "s(\\mathbf{r}) = \\int_a^b \\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\| \\, dt\n",
       "$$\n",
       "Here, $\\mathbf{r}'(t)$ is the derivative of $\\mathbf{r}(t)$, representing the velocity vector along the curve, and $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$ is its magnitude (speed).\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Note on Mean Value Theorem (MVT)\n",
       "\n",
       "The usual Mean Value Theorem from calculus does **not** apply directly to vector-valued functions in the same way. However, in two dimensions ($\\mathbb{R}^2$), there exists some $c \\in (a,b)$ such that the derivative $\\mathbf{r}'(c)$ is parallel to the vector $\\mathbf{r}(b) - \\mathbf{r}(a)$.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Changing the Parameter of a Curve\n",
       "\n",
       "Sometimes, we want to reparametrize the curve, meaning we change the parameter $t$ to a new parameter $\\tau$ via a function $t = g(\\tau)$. This produces a new vector function $\\mathbf{r}(g(\\tau))$ that traces the same curve but possibly at a different speed or direction.\n",
       "\n",
       "The **Chain Rule** applies here: if $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ and $g(\\tau)$ are differentiable, then $\\mathbf{r}(g(\\tau))$ is differentiable with respect to $\\tau$, and its derivative is:\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\\frac{d}{d\\tau} \\mathbf{r}(g(\\tau)) = \\mathbf{r}'(g(\\tau)) \\cdot g'(\\tau)\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Arc Length Parameterization\n",
       "\n",
       "A special and very useful parameterization of a curve is the **arc length parameterization**. Instead of using an arbitrary parameter $t$, we use the arc length $s$ itself as the parameter.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given a reference point $\\mathbf{r}(t_0)$ on the curve, the arc length from this point to $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is:\n",
       "$$\n",
       "s = \\int_{t_0}^t \\|\\mathbf{r}'(u)\\| \\, du\n",
       "$$\n",
       "This means $s$ measures the distance traveled along the curve starting from $t_0$.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Key Properties of Arc Length Parameterization\n",
       "\n",
       "- When the curve is parameterized by arc length $s$, the magnitude of the velocity vector is always 1:\n",
       "  $$\n",
       "  \\left\\|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right\\| = 1\n",
       "  $$\n",
       "- This means the curve is traced at a constant speed of 1 unit per unit of $s$.\n",
       "- If the original parameter $t$ already satisfies $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\| = 1$, then $t$ itself is an arc length parameter (up to a shift).\n",

       "\n",
       "**Correct answers:** A, C, D  \n",
       "**Explanation:**  \n",
       "- A is correct because arc length is defined as the supremum of sums of distances between points on the curve over all partitions.  \n",
       "- C is correct because a curve is rectifiable if its arc length is finite (a real number).  \n",
       "- D is correct because if $\\mathbf{r}$ is continuously differentiable, the arc length can be computed exactly by the integral of the speed $\\|\\mathbf{r}'(t)\\|$.  \n",
