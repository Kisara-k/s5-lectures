       "\n",
       "Residue theory is a powerful tool in complex analysis that allows us to evaluate complex contour integrals by examining the singularities (poles) of a function inside a contour. While initially developed for complex integrals, residue theory can also be cleverly applied to evaluate certain real integrals that are difficult or impossible to solve using standard calculus techniques.\n",
       "\n",
       "Throughout this course, you have learned that integrals over curves in three-dimensional space or contours in the complex plane can often be transformed into integrals over real intervals by suitable parametrizations. This process can be reversed: by extending real integrals into the complex plane and using residues, we can evaluate real integrals that are otherwise challenging.\n",
