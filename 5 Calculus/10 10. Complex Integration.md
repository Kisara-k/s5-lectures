## 10. Complex Integration

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on the lecture content you provided on **Complex Integration**. The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step without skipping any important details.



### 1. 🧮 Introduction to Complex Integration

Complex integration extends the idea of integration from real-valued functions to complex-valued functions. Instead of integrating over a real interval, we integrate functions whose inputs and outputs are complex numbers. This is fundamental in complex analysis and has many applications in physics and engineering.



### 2. 📐 Complex Integrals: Definition and Basic Properties

#### What is a Complex Integral?

Suppose we have a complex-valued function \( f(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \), where \( u(t) \) and \( v(t) \) are real-valued functions of a real variable \( t \) defined on an interval \([a, b]\). Here, \( i \) is the imaginary unit with \( i^2 = -1 \).

- Since \( u(t) \) and \( v(t) \) are real functions, if they are continuous on \([a, b]\), they are integrable in the usual real sense.
- We define the integral of \( f(t) \) over \([a, b]\) as:
  \[
  \int_a^b f(t) \, dt = \int_a^b u(t) \, dt + i \int_a^b v(t) \, dt
  \]
  
This means the integral of a complex function is just the integral of its real part plus \( i \) times the integral of its imaginary part.

#### Fundamental Theorem for Complex Integrals

If \( U(t) \) and \( V(t) \) are antiderivatives of \( u(t) \) and \( v(t) \) respectively (meaning \( U'(t) = u(t) \) and \( V'(t) = v(t) \)), then:
\[
\int_a^b f(t) \, dt = [U(b) - U(a)] + i [V(b) - V(a)]
\]

This is a direct extension of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to complex functions.

#### Properties of Complex Integrals

If \( f(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \) and \( g(t) = p(t) + iq(t) \) are continuous on \([a, b]\), then:

1. **Linearity**: The integral of the sum is the sum of the integrals:
   \[
   \int_a^b [f(t) + g(t)] \, dt = \int_a^b f(t) \, dt + \int_a^b g(t) \, dt
   \]

This property allows us to break down complex integrals into simpler parts.



### 3. 🧭 Contours and Contour Integrals

#### What is a Contour?

In complex integration, instead of integrating over a real interval, we integrate over a path or curve in the complex plane. Such a curve is called a **contour**.

- A **contour** \( C \) is a curve made by joining a finite number of smooth curves end to end.
- The contour has a starting point \( A \) and an ending point \( B \).

#### Parametrization of a Contour

To integrate over a contour, we describe it using a parameter \( t \) that runs from \( a \) to \( b \). The contour is represented by a function:
\[
z(t) = x(t) + i y(t), \quad a \leq t \leq b
\]
where \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \) are real-valued functions describing the path in the plane.

#### Defining the Contour Integral

Suppose \( f(z) \) is a complex-valued function defined on the contour \( C \). We partition the contour into small segments:
\[
P_n = \{ z_0 = A, z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n = B \}
\]
and define increments:
\[
\Delta z_k = z_k - z_{k-1}
\]
For each segment, pick a point \( c_k \) between \( z_{k-1} \) and \( z_k \). The **Riemann sum** for the contour integral is:
\[
S(P_n) = \sum_{k=1}^n f(c_k) \Delta z_k
\]

If the limit of these sums exists as the partition gets finer (i.e., \( n \to \infty \)), we define the contour integral as:
\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz = \lim_{n \to \infty} S(P_n)
\]

#### Evaluating Contour Integrals via Parametrization

If \( z(t) \) parametrizes the contour \( C \), then the contour integral can be computed as:
\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz = \int_a^b f(z(t)) z'(t) \, dt
\]
This converts the complex contour integral into a standard integral over a real interval.



### 4. 🔍 Important Inequalities in Complex Integration

#### Integral Triangle Inequality

For a continuous complex function \( f(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \), the absolute value of the integral is bounded by the integral of the absolute value:
\[
\left| \int_a^b f(t) \, dt \right| \leq \int_a^b |f(t)| \, dt
\]
This inequality is useful for estimating the size of integrals.

#### ML Inequality (Estimation Lemma)

If \( f(z) \) is continuous on a contour \( C \) of length \( L \), and \( M \) is an upper bound for \( |f(z)| \) on \( C \), then:
\[
\left| \int_C f(z) \, dz \right| \leq M L
\]
This is a powerful tool to estimate the maximum possible value of a contour integral without computing it exactly.



### 5. 🌀 Cauchy-Goursat Theorem and Its Consequences

#### What is the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem?

This is a fundamental result in complex analysis. It states:

- If \( f \) is **analytic** (complex differentiable) in a simply connected domain \( D \),
- And \( C \) is a simple closed contour lying entirely in \( D \),
- Then the contour integral of \( f \) around \( C \) is zero:
\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz = 0
\]

This theorem tells us that for analytic functions, the integral around any closed loop in a simply connected domain is zero, which is a key property that distinguishes complex integration from real integration.

#### Deformation of Contour Lemma

If \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are two simple closed contours with \( C_1 \) inside \( C_2 \), and \( f \) is analytic in the region between them, then:
\[
\int_{C_1} f(z) \, dz = \int_{C_2} f(z) \, dz
\]
This means the integral depends only on the "holes" or singularities inside the contour, not on the exact shape of the contour.

#### Extended Cauchy-Goursat Theorem

If you have multiple simple closed contours \( C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n \) inside a larger contour \( C \), and \( f \) is analytic in the region containing all these contours and the space between them, then:
\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz = \sum_{k=1}^n \int_{C_k} f(z) \, dz
\]
This allows breaking down complex integrals over complicated regions into sums of integrals over simpler contours.



### 6. 🧩 Examples and Applications

#### Example 1: Integrating a Polynomial

Show that:
\[
\int (t - i)^3 \, dt = \ldots
\]
This involves expanding the polynomial and integrating term-by-term using the linearity of integrals.

#### Example 2: Exponential Function Integral

Evaluate:
\[
\int e^{t + it} \, dt
\]
Since \( e^{t + it} = e^t e^{i t} \), this can be separated into real and imaginary parts and integrated accordingly.

#### Example 3: Parametrizing a Polygonal Path

Given points \( -1 + i \) to \( 3 - i \), find a parametrization of the polygonal path \( C \). This involves expressing the path as piecewise linear functions of \( t \).

#### Example 4: Using Riemann Sums for Approximation

Approximate the contour integral of \( e^z \) along a line segment from \( 0 \) to \( 2 + 4i \) by partitioning the path and summing values of \( f \) times increments \( \Delta z_k \).

#### Example 5: Integral over a Semi-Circle

Evaluate:
\[
\int_C (z - 2) \, dz
\]
where \( C \) is the upper semi-circle of radius 1 centered at \( x=2 \), oriented counter-clockwise. Parametrize the semi-circle and compute the integral.

#### Example 6: Different Paths, Same Integral

Show that the integral of \( z \, dz \) over two different paths \( C_1 \) (line segment) and \( C_2 \) (parabolic path) joining the same points yields the same result \( 4 + 2i \). This illustrates path independence for analytic functions.

#### Example 7: Different Paths, Different Integrals

Show that integrals over different paths between the same points can differ if the function or domain conditions are not met, e.g.:
\[
\int_{C_1} \frac{1}{z} \, dz = \pi i, \quad \int_{C_2} \frac{1}{z} \, dz = -4i
\]
where \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are different semi-circular and polygonal paths.

#### Example 8 & 9: Using ML Inequality

Find upper bounds for integrals like:
\[
\int_C (z^2 + 9)^2 \, dz
\]
where \( C \) is a circle of radius \( R > 3 \), and
\[
\int_C \frac{z+4}{z^3 - 1} \, dz
\]
where \( C \) is an arc of a circle in the first quadrant.

#### Example 10: Integral Around a Point

If \( C \) is a simple closed contour enclosing a point \( z_0 \), then:
\[
\int_C \frac{1}{z - z_0} \, dz = 2 \pi i
\]
and for powers \( n \neq 1 \):
\[
\int_C (z - z_0)^n \, dz = 0
\]
This is a key result related to residues and singularities.

#### Examples 11-13: Integrals Over Circles and Figure-Eight Contours

- For \( C \) the circle \( |z| = 2 \):
  \[
  \int_C (z^2 + 2) \, dz = 4 \pi i
  \]
- For \( C \) the circle \( |z - i| = 1 \):
  \[
  \int_C (z^2 + 2) \, dz = 2 \pi i
  \]
- For a figure-eight contour \( C \):
  \[
  \int_C \frac{z - 2}{z^2 - z} \, dz = -6 \pi i
  \]

These examples illustrate how contour integrals depend on the singularities enclosed by the contour.



### Summary

- Complex integration generalizes real integration to complex-valued functions.
- Contour integrals are integrals over paths in the complex plane, evaluated via parametrization.
- The Cauchy-Goursat theorem is fundamental, stating integrals of analytic functions over closed contours in simply connected domains are zero.
- The ML inequality helps estimate integrals without exact calculation.
- Integral values depend on the path only through the singularities enclosed.
- These concepts form the foundation for advanced topics like residue theory and complex function theory.
