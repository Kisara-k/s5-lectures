       "\n",
       "The basic fixed-point iteration uses the previous iteration vector $ \\mathbf{x}^{(k-1)} $ to compute the next $ \\mathbf{x}^{(k)} $. The **Gauss-Seidel method** improves on this by using the most recent updated values within the same iteration step.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, when computing $ x_2^{(k)} $, instead of using $ x_1^{(k-1)} $, use the newly computed $ x_1^{(k)} $. This often speeds up convergence because it incorporates the latest information immediately.\n",

       "### 6. üßÆ Newton's Method for Nonlinear Systems\n",
       "\n",
       "While fixed-point iteration is useful, it often requires explicitly solving each equation for one variable, which is not always possible. **Newton's method** provides a more general and powerful approach.\n",

       "##### Idea Behind Newton's Method\n",
       "\n",
       "Newton's method aims to find the root of $ F(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0} $ by iteratively improving guesses $ \\mathbf{x}^{(k)} $ using the Jacobian matrix $ J(\\mathbf{x}) $, which contains all first-order partial derivatives of $ F $:\n",

       "### 7. üß© The Jacobian Matrix and Its Role\n",
       "\n",
       "The **Jacobian matrix** $ J(\\mathbf{x}) $ is central to Newton's method. It generalizes the derivative to multiple variables and functions.\n",
