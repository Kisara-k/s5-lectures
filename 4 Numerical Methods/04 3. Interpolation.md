## 3. Interpolation

## Key Points

#### 1. 🧩 Cubic Spline Definition  
- A cubic spline interpolant $S$ consists of piecewise cubic polynomials $S_j(x)$ defined on intervals $[x_j, x_{j+1}]$.  
- Each cubic polynomial has 4 coefficients: $a_j, b_j, c_j, d_j$.  
- For $n+1$ data points, there are $n$ cubic polynomials and $4n$ unknown coefficients.

#### 2. 📏 Conditions for Cubic Splines  
- $S_j(x_j) = f(x_j)$ and $S_j(x_{j+1}) = f(x_{j+1})$ (interpolates data points).  
- $S_j(x_{j+1}) = S_{j+1}(x_{j+1})$ (continuity of function at interior nodes).  
- $S_j'(x_{j+1}) = S_{j+1}'(x_{j+1})$ (continuous first derivative at interior nodes).  
- $S_j''(x_{j+1}) = S_{j+1}''(x_{j+1})$ (continuous second derivative at interior nodes).  
- Boundary conditions must be specified to uniquely determine the spline.

#### 3. 🛠 Boundary Conditions  
- **Natural spline:** $S''(x_0) = 0$ and $S''(x_n) = 0$.  
- **Clamped spline:** $S'(x_0) = f'(x_0)$ and $S'(x_n) = f'(x_n)$.  
- Natural splines approximate the shape of a flexible rod passing through points.  
- Clamped splines generally provide more accurate approximations if endpoint derivatives are known.

#### 4. 🔢 Number of Equations and Unknowns  
- Total unknowns: $4n$ coefficients for $n$ cubic polynomials.  
- Total equations: $2n$ from interpolation + $n-1$ from first derivative continuity + $n-1$ from second derivative continuity + 2 from boundary conditions = $4n$.

#### 5. 🧮 Key Linear System for Second Derivatives  
- The second derivatives $c_j$ satisfy the tridiagonal system:


$$
h_{j-1} c_{j-1} + 2(h_{j-1} + h_j) c_j + h_j c_{j+1} = 3 \left( \frac{a_{j+1} - a_j}{h_j} - \frac{a_j - a_{j-1}}{h_{j-1}} \right), \quad j=1, \ldots, n-1
$$


- $h_j = x_{j+1} - x_j$, $a_j = f(x_j)$.  
- For natural splines, $c_0 = 0$ and $c_n = 0$.  
- For clamped splines, boundary conditions modify the first and last equations.

#### 6. ✅ Existence and Uniqueness  
- The coefficient matrix of the linear system is strictly diagonally dominant, ensuring a unique solution.  
- Unique natural spline exists for any set of nodes and function values.  
- Unique clamped spline exists if endpoint derivatives are known.

#### 7. 🧪 Example Data for Clamped Spline  
- Given points $(0,1), (1,e), (2,e^2), (3,e^3)$ and derivatives $f'(0)=1$, $f'(3)=e^3$, the clamped spline can be constructed by solving the linear system for $c_j$.

#### 8. 📉 Error Bound for Cubic Splines  
- If $f \in C^4[a,b]$ and $M = \max |f^{(4)}(x)|$, then for clamped spline $S$:


$$
|f(x) - S(x)| \leq \frac{5}{384} M h^4, \quad h = \max_j (x_{j+1} - x_j)
$$


- Error decreases as the fourth power of the maximum subinterval length $h$.  
- A similar fourth-order error bound exists for natural splines but is more complex to express.

## Study Notes

### 1. 🧩 What is Interpolation and Why Use Cubic Splines?

**Interpolation** is a method used to estimate values between known data points. Imagine you have a set of points on a graph, and you want to draw a smooth curve that passes exactly through all these points. This curve is called an **interpolating function**.

**Cubic spline interpolation** is a popular technique where the interpolating function is made up of several cubic polynomials, each defined on a small interval between two consecutive data points. Instead of fitting one big polynomial to all points (which can oscillate wildly), cubic splines fit smaller cubic polynomials piecewise, ensuring smoothness and continuity.

Why cubic splines? Because they provide a smooth curve that not only passes through the data points but also has continuous first and second derivatives, making the curve look natural and smooth—like a flexible rod bent through the points.


### 2. 🧮 Defining the Cubic Spline Interpolant

Suppose you have **n + 1** data points:


$$
(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)
$$


where $a = x_0 < x_1 < \cdots < x_n = b$.

A **cubic spline interpolant** $S(x)$ is a function made up of $n$ cubic polynomials $S_j(x)$, each defined on the interval $[x_j, x_{j+1}]$ for $j = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$.

Each cubic polynomial has the form:


$$
S_j(x) = a_j (x - x_j)^3 + b_j (x - x_j)^2 + c_j (x - x_j) + d_j
$$


or equivalently:


$$
S_j(x) = a_j x^3 + b_j x^2 + c_j x + d_j
$$


but the shifted form (using $x - x_j$) is often more convenient.

#### Conditions the spline must satisfy:

1. **Interpolation condition:** The spline passes through the data points:


$$
S_j(x_j) = y_j, \quad S_j(x_{j+1}) = y_{j+1}
$$


2. **Continuity at interior points:** The spline pieces join smoothly:


$$
S_j(x_{j+1}) = S_{j+1}(x_{j+1}) \quad \text{for } j = 0, \ldots, n-2
$$


3. **Continuous first derivative:** The slope is continuous at interior points:


$$
S_j'(x_{j+1}) = S_{j+1}'(x_{j+1}) \quad \text{for } j = 0, \ldots, n-2
$$


4. **Continuous second derivative:** The curvature is continuous at interior points:


$$
S_j''(x_{j+1}) = S_{j+1}''(x_{j+1}) \quad \text{for } j = 0, \ldots, n-2
$$


5. **Boundary conditions:** To uniquely determine the spline, we need two additional conditions at the endpoints $x_0$ and $x_n$. Common choices are:

- **Natural (or free) boundary conditions:**


$$
S''(x_0) = 0, \quad S''(x_n) = 0
$$


This means the spline is "relaxed" at the ends, like a free bending rod.

- **Clamped boundary conditions:**


$$
S'(x_0) = f'(x_0), \quad S'(x_n) = f'(x_n)
$$


Here, the slope at the endpoints is fixed to match the derivative of the underlying function (if known).


### 3. 🔢 How Many Unknowns and Equations?

For $n$ intervals, there are $n$ cubic polynomials, each with 4 coefficients:


$$
4n \quad \text{unknown coefficients}
$$


We need $4n$ independent equations to solve for these coefficients.

- **Interpolation at nodes:** $2n$ equations (each polynomial passes through two points).
- **Continuity of function at interior points:** $n-1$ equations (already implied by interpolation).
- **Continuity of first derivative at interior points:** $n-1$ equations.
- **Continuity of second derivative at interior points:** $n-1$ equations.
- **Boundary conditions:** 2 equations.

Adding these up:


$$
2n + (n-1) + (n-1) + 2 = 4n
$$


which matches the number of unknowns.


### 4. 🛠 Constructing a Natural Cubic Spline: Step-by-Step

Let's walk through the process of constructing a **natural cubic spline** for a simple example with three points:


$$
(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 5)
$$


#### Step 1: Define the cubic polynomials

We have two intervals: $[1, 2]$ and $[2, 3]$, so two cubic polynomials:


$$
S_0(x) = a_0 x^3 + b_0 x^2 + c_0 x + d_0, \quad x \in [1, 2]
$$


$$
S_1(x) = a_1 x^3 + b_1 x^2 + c_1 x + d_1, \quad x \in [2, 3]
$$


There are 8 unknowns: $a_0, b_0, c_0, d_0, a_1, b_1, c_1, d_1$.

#### Step 2: Apply interpolation conditions

The spline must pass through the points:


$$
S_0(1) = 2, \quad S_0(2) = 3
$$


$$
S_1(2) = 3, \quad S_1(3) = 5
$$


This gives 4 equations.

#### Step 3: Apply continuity of first and second derivatives at $x=2$


$$
S_0'(2) = S_1'(2)
$$


$$
S_0''(2) = S_1''(2)
$$


This gives 2 more equations.

#### Step 4: Apply natural boundary conditions


$$
S_0''(1) = 0, \quad S_1''(3) = 0
$$


This gives the final 2 equations.

#### Step 5: Solve the system of 8 equations for the 8 unknowns

Solving these equations yields the coefficients of the two cubic polynomials, which together form the natural cubic spline.


### 5. 📏 General Formulas and Notation for Cubic Splines

To simplify calculations, define:

- $h_j = x_{j+1} - x_j$ (the width of each subinterval)
- $a_j = f(x_j)$ (function values at nodes)

The cubic spline on $[x_j, x_{j+1}]$ can be written as:


$$
S_j(x) = a_j + b_j (x - x_j) + c_j (x - x_j)^2 + d_j (x - x_j)^3
$$


The coefficients satisfy:

- $a_{j+1} = a_j + b_j h_j + c_j h_j^2 + d_j h_j^3$
- $b_{j+1} = b_j + 2 c_j h_j + 3 d_j h_j^2$
- $c_{j+1} = c_j + 3 d_j h_j$

Using these relations and the boundary conditions, a system of linear equations can be formed to solve for the $c_j$ coefficients first, then $b_j$ and $d_j$.


### 6. 🧮 The Linear System for the Second Derivatives

The key step in cubic spline interpolation is solving for the second derivatives at the nodes, which are related to the $c_j$ coefficients.

The system is:


$$
h_{j-1} c_{j-1} + 2(h_{j-1} + h_j) c_j + h_j c_{j+1} = 3 \left( \frac{a_{j+1} - a_j}{h_j} - \frac{a_j - a_{j-1}}{h_{j-1}} \right), \quad j=1, \ldots, n-1
$$


This is a tridiagonal system (only the main diagonal and the two adjacent diagonals have nonzero entries), which can be solved efficiently.

- For **natural splines**, the boundary conditions are $c_0 = 0$ and $c_n = 0$.
- For **clamped splines**, the boundary conditions involve the first derivatives at the endpoints and modify the first and last equations accordingly.


### 7. ✅ Existence and Uniqueness Theorems

- **Theorem 3.0.1 (Natural spline):** For any function $f$ defined on $[a, b]$ with nodes $x_0 < \cdots < x_n$, there exists a unique natural cubic spline interpolant $S$ satisfying $S''(a) = 0$ and $S''(b) = 0$.

- **Theorem 3.0.2 (Clamped spline):** If $f$ is differentiable at the endpoints $a$ and $b$, then there exists a unique clamped cubic spline interpolant $S$ satisfying $S'(a) = f'(a)$ and $S'(b) = f'(b)$.

The uniqueness follows from the fact that the coefficient matrix in the linear system is strictly diagonally dominant, ensuring a unique solution.


### 8. 🧪 Example: Clamped Cubic Spline for $f(x) = e^x$

Given points:


$$
(0, 1), (1, e), (2, e^2), (3, e^3)
$$


and derivatives at endpoints:


$$
f'(0) = 1, \quad f'(3) = e^3
$$


We want to construct a clamped cubic spline $S(x)$ on $[0, 3]$.

- Step sizes: $h_0 = h_1 = h_2 = 1$
- Function values: $a_0 = 1, a_1 = e, a_2 = e^2, a_3 = e^3$

Set up the linear system for $c_j$ using the clamped boundary conditions and solve for $c_0, c_1, c_2, c_3$.

Once $c_j$ are found, calculate $b_j$ and $d_j$ to get the full spline.


### 9. 📉 Error Bound for Cubic Splines

The error between the true function $f$ and the cubic spline $S$ can be bounded if $f$ is sufficiently smooth (has continuous fourth derivative).

**Theorem 3.0.3:**

If $f \in C^4[a,b]$ and


$$
M = \max_{x \in [a,b]} |f^{(4)}(x)|
$$


then for all $x \in [a,b]$,


$$
|f(x) - S(x)| \leq \frac{5}{384} M h^4
$$


where $h = \max_j (x_{j+1} - x_j)$ is the maximum spacing between nodes.

This means the error decreases rapidly as the nodes get closer together (since error depends on $h^4$).
