       "### 1. üü¶ Diagonally Dominant Matrices\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Introduction  \n",
       "Diagonally dominant matrices are a special class of square matrices where the diagonal elements are \"dominant\" compared to the other elements in their respective rows. This property is important because it guarantees certain desirable behaviors, such as nonsingularity (invertibility) and numerical stability when solving linear systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### What is Diagonal Dominance?  \n",
       "Consider an $ n \\times n $ matrix $ A = (a_{ij}) $. The matrix $ A $ is **diagonally dominant** if, for every row $ i $, the absolute value of the diagonal element $ |a_{ii}| $ is at least as large as the sum of the absolute values of the other elements in that row:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$\n",
       "|a_{ii}| \\geq \\sum_{j \\neq i} |a_{ij}|\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "If the inequality is strict for every row, i.e.,\n",
       "\n",
       "$$\n",
       "|a_{ii}| > \\sum_{j \\neq i} |a_{ij}|\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "then $ A $ is called **strictly diagonally dominant**.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Why is this important?  \n",
       "Strict diagonal dominance ensures that the matrix is **nonsingular** (invertible). This means the system $ Ax = b $ has a unique solution. Moreover, Gaussian elimination can be performed without needing to swap rows or columns, which simplifies computations and improves numerical stability.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Example  \n",
       "- Matrix $ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 7 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 5 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} $ is strictly diagonally dominant because, for each row, the diagonal element is greater than the sum of the other elements in that row.\n",
       "- Matrix $ B = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 & 4 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 6 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} $ is not strictly diagonally dominant because, for example, in the first row, $ |6| < |4| + |3| = 7 $.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Theorem  \n",
       "- **Strictly diagonally dominant matrices are nonsingular.**  \n",
       "- Gaussian elimination on such matrices is stable and does not require pivoting (row or column interchanges).\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. üü© Positive Definite Matrices\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Introduction  \n",
       "Positive definite matrices are another important class of matrices, especially in optimization, statistics, and numerical analysis. They have properties that guarantee unique solutions and stability in computations.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Definition  \n",
       "A matrix $ A $ is **positive definite** if:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. $ A $ is **symmetric** (i.e., $ A = A^T $), and  \n",
       "2. For every nonzero vector $ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n $, the quadratic form $ x^T A x > 0 $.\n",
       "\n",
       "This means that when you multiply $ A $ by any nonzero vector $ x $, the result is always a positive scalar.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Key Properties  \n",
       "- All eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix are **positive** (or at least non-negative).\n",
       "- A symmetric matrix $ A $ is positive definite **if and only if** all its **leading principal submatrices** have positive determinants.  \n",
       "  - A **leading principal submatrix** is a submatrix formed by taking the first $ k $ rows and columns of $ A $, for $ k = 1, 2, ..., n $.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Why does this matter?  \n",
       "Positive definiteness ensures that certain matrix factorizations (like Cholesky decomposition) exist and are numerically stable. It also guarantees that the system $ Ax = b $ has a unique solution and that Gaussian elimination can be performed without row interchanges, with all pivot elements positive.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Example  \n",
       "Given a symmetric matrix $ A $, you can check positive definiteness by verifying the positivity of determinants of its leading principal submatrices.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. üìè Vector and Matrix Norms\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Introduction  \n",
       "Norms provide a way to measure the \"size\" or \"length\" of vectors and matrices. They are essential in numerical analysis to understand errors, convergence, and stability.\n",

       "\n",
       "- $ \\|v\\|_1 = |{-5}| + |1| + |3| = 9 $  \n",
       "- $ \\|v\\|_2 = \\sqrt{(-5)^2 + 1^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 1 + 9} = \\sqrt{35} \\approx 5.92 $  \n",

       "##### Matrix Norms  \n",

       "##### Spectral Radius  \n",
       "The **spectral radius** $ \\rho(A) $ of a matrix $ A $ is the maximum absolute value of its eigenvalues. It plays a key role in understanding matrix behavior, especially in iterative methods.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. üî∫ LU Decomposition\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Introduction  \n",
       "LU decomposition is a method to factor a square matrix $ A $ into the product of a **lower triangular matrix** $ L $ and an **upper triangular matrix** $ U $:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$\n",
       "A = LU\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "This factorization simplifies solving linear systems, computing determinants, and finding inverses.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### What are $ L $ and $ U $?  \n",
       "- $ L $ is a lower triangular matrix: all entries above the main diagonal are zero.  \n",
       "- $ U $ is an upper triangular matrix: all entries below the main diagonal are zero.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### How to use LU decomposition to solve $ Ax = b $?  \n",
       "1. Write $ A = LU $, so $ LUx = b $.  \n",
       "2. Let $ Ux = y $. First solve $ Ly = b $ by **forward substitution** (easy because $ L $ is lower triangular).  \n",
       "3. Then solve $ Ux = y $ by **backward substitution** (easy because $ U $ is upper triangular).  \n",
       "4. The solution $ x $ is the solution to the original system.\n",

       "- If Gaussian elimination can be done without row swaps, $ A $ can be factored as $ LU $.  \n",
       "- The diagonal entries of $ L $ are often set to 1 (Doolittle factorization). Alternatively, $ U $ can have 1's on the diagonal (Crout factorization).\n",
