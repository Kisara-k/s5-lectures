## Study Notes

### 1. üßÆ Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations

A **system of linear equations** is a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. For example, if you have variables \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \), a system of \( m \) linear equations looks like this:

\[
\begin{cases}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \cdots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2 \\
\vdots \\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m
\end{cases}
\]

Here, the \( a_{ij} \) are coefficients (real numbers), and the \( b_i \) are constants on the right side of the equations.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Homogeneous system:** When all \( b_i = 0 \), the system is called *homogeneous*. It always has at least the trivial solution \( x = 0 \).
- **Non-homogeneous system:** When at least one \( b_i \neq 0 \), the system is *non-homogeneous*.
- The system can be written compactly as \( Ax = b \), where:
  - \( A \) is the **coefficient matrix** (contains all \( a_{ij} \)),
  - \( x \) is the vector of unknowns,
  - \( b \) is the constants vector.
- The **augmented matrix** \([A|b]\) combines the coefficient matrix and the constants for easier manipulation.

#### Possible outcomes when solving \( Ax = b \):
- **Unique solution:** Exactly one set of values for \( x \) satisfies all equations.
- **Infinitely many solutions:** There are multiple solutions, often due to dependent equations.
- **No solution:** The system is inconsistent (e.g., parallel lines that never intersect).


### 2. üîÑ Elementary Operations and Equivalent Systems

To solve systems of linear equations, we often manipulate the equations to simplify them. These manipulations are called **elementary operations** and are crucial because they do not change the solution set.

#### The three elementary operations are:

1. **Interchange two equations:** Swap the positions of two equations.
2. **Multiply an equation by a non-zero constant:** Scale an entire equation by a constant \( c \neq 0 \).
3. **Replace an equation by itself plus a multiple of another equation:** For example, replace equation \( k \) by \( \text{equation } k + c \times \text{equation } j \).

These operations are reversible, meaning you can undo them by applying inverse operations.

#### Why are these important?

- Applying these operations transforms the system into an **equivalent system** ‚Äî one that has exactly the same solutions as the original.
- This allows us to simplify the system step-by-step until it becomes easy to solve.

#### Row operations on matrices:

When working with matrices, these operations correspond to **elementary row operations**:

- Swap two rows.
- Multiply a row by a non-zero constant.
- Add a multiple of one row to another row.

Two matrices are **row-equivalent** if one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of these row operations.


### 3. üî∫ Gaussian Elimination Method

**Gaussian elimination** is a systematic procedure to solve linear systems by transforming the augmented matrix into an **upper triangular form** (all zeros below the main diagonal). Once in this form, the system can be solved easily by **back substitution**.

#### How Gaussian elimination works:

1. **Forward elimination:**
   - Start with the first column and eliminate the variable \( x_1 \) from all rows below the first.
   - Move to the second column and eliminate \( x_2 \) from all rows below the second.
   - Continue this process until the matrix is in upper triangular form.

2. **Back substitution:**
   - Solve for the last variable \( x_n \) from the last equation.
   - Substitute \( x_n \) into the second last equation to solve for \( x_{n-1} \).
   - Continue substituting back until all variables are found.

#### Important notes:

- The **pivot element** is the element in the current row and column used to eliminate variables below it.
- The process relies on the pivot element being non-zero to avoid division by zero.


### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls and Pivoting in Gaussian Elimination

While Gaussian elimination is powerful, it has some challenges:

#### Division by zero:

- If the pivot element is zero, you cannot divide by it to eliminate variables.
- This can happen if the matrix has zeros on the diagonal during elimination.

#### Small pivot elements and round-off errors:

- Even if the pivot is not zero but very small compared to other elements, numerical errors can become significant.
- This can lead to inaccurate solutions due to **round-off errors** in computer calculations.

#### Pivoting techniques to avoid these problems:

- **Partial pivoting:** Before eliminating variables in a column, swap the current row with a row below that has the largest absolute value in that column. This ensures the pivot element is as large as possible, reducing round-off errors.
- **Complete pivoting:** Swap both rows and columns to place the largest element in the pivot position. This is more complex and less commonly used because it changes the order of variables.
- **Scaled partial pivoting:** Takes into account the relative size of elements in each row to decide which row to swap, improving stability.


### 5. üìä Ill-Conditioned vs Well-Conditioned Systems

When solving linear systems numerically, the **condition** of the coefficient matrix \( A \) is crucial.

#### Well-conditioned system:

- Small changes in the coefficients or constants lead to small changes in the solution.
- These systems are stable and reliable to solve numerically.

#### Ill-conditioned system:

- Small changes in the coefficients or constants cause large changes in the solution.
- These systems are sensitive to round-off errors and numerical instability.
- The **condition number** of a matrix measures this sensitivity. A large condition number indicates ill-conditioning.

#### Why does this matter?

- Ill-conditioned systems are difficult to solve accurately using numerical methods.
- Round-off errors, which are inevitable in computer calculations, can cause large errors in the solution.
- When possible, avoid ill-conditioned systems or use specialized numerical techniques to handle them.


### 6. üìù Summary and Practical Tips

- Systems of linear equations can be solved using **direct methods** like Gaussian elimination or **iterative methods** (not covered here).
- Use **elementary row operations** to simplify systems without changing their solutions.
- Apply **Gaussian elimination** to reduce the system to upper triangular form, then solve by back substitution.
- Always check for zero or small pivot elements to avoid division by zero or large numerical errors.
- Use **pivoting** (especially partial pivoting) to improve numerical stability.
- Be aware of the condition of your system; ill-conditioned systems require careful handling.
- Understanding these concepts is essential for implementing reliable numerical algorithms for solving linear systems.
