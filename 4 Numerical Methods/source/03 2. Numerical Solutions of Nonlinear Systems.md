- If the partial derivatives of \( G \) are continuous and bounded by a constant \( K < 1 \), the fixed point is unique and the iteration \( \mathbf{x}^{(k)} = G(\mathbf{x}^{(k-1)}) \) converges to it for any \( \mathbf{x}^{(0)} \in D \).  

#### 3. üîÑ Fixed-Point Form of Nonlinear Systems

## Study Notes

### 1. üî¢ Understanding Nonlinear Systems of Equations

When we talk about **nonlinear systems of equations**, we mean a set of equations where the unknown variables appear in nonlinear ways‚Äîlike inside trigonometric functions, powers, products, or other nonlinear expressions. Formally, a nonlinear system with *n* equations and *n* unknowns looks like this:

\[
\begin{cases}
f_1(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = 0 \\
f_2(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = 0 \\
\vdots \\
f_n(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = 0
\end{cases}
\]

Here, each \( f_i \) is a function that takes an *n*-dimensional vector \( \mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)^T \) and outputs a real number. We can think of the whole system as a single vector function:

\[
F(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{pmatrix} f_1(\mathbf{x}) \\ f_2(\mathbf{x}) \\ \vdots \\ f_n(\mathbf{x}) \end{pmatrix}
\]

where \( F: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n \).

**Why use vector notation?** It simplifies the system into one compact expression \( F(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} \), making it easier to analyze and apply numerical methods.


### 2. üìç Fixed Points in Multidimensional Spaces

A **fixed point** of a function \( G: D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n \) is a point \( \mathbf{p} \in D \) such that:

\[
G(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{p}
\]

This means applying the function \( G \) to \( \mathbf{p} \) returns \( \mathbf{p} \) itself.

#### Fixed-Point Theorem (Multidimensional Version)

If \( G \) is continuous on a closed, bounded domain \( D \) (like a box in \( \mathbb{R}^n \)) and maps \( D \) into itself (meaning \( G(\mathbf{x}) \in D \) for all \( \mathbf{x} \in D \)), then **there exists at least one fixed point** in \( D \).

Moreover, if the partial derivatives of the components of \( G \) are continuous and satisfy a certain contraction condition (the derivatives are bounded by a constant \( K < 1 \)), then:

- The fixed point is **unique**.
- The iterative sequence defined by \( \mathbf{x}^{(k)} = G(\mathbf{x}^{(k-1)}) \) converges to this fixed point for any starting point \( \mathbf{x}^{(0)} \in D \).

This is a powerful result because it guarantees both existence and uniqueness of solutions under these conditions, and it provides a method to approximate the solution by iteration.


### 3. üîÑ Transforming Nonlinear Systems into Fixed-Point Problems

To solve a nonlinear system numerically, one common approach is to rewrite it in **fixed-point form**:

\[
\mathbf{x} = G(\mathbf{x})
\]

This means solving each equation for one variable \( x_i \) in terms of the others, creating functions \( g_i \) such that:

\[
x_i = g_i(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
\]

#### Example

Given the nonlinear system:

\[
\begin{cases}
3x_1 - \cos(x_2 x_3) - 1 = 0 \\
81(x_2 + 0.1)^2 + \sin x_3 + 1.06 = 0 \\
\text{(and a third equation)}
\end{cases}
\]

We solve each equation for \( x_i \) to get:

\[
x_1 = \frac{\cos(x_2 x_3) + 1}{3}, \quad x_2 = \text{some function of } x_1, x_3, \quad x_3 = \text{some function of } x_1, x_2
\]

This defines \( G(\mathbf{x}) = (g_1(\mathbf{x}), g_2(\mathbf{x}), g_3(\mathbf{x}))^T \).


### 4. ‚úÖ Conditions for Convergence and Continuity

To ensure the fixed-point iteration converges to the true solution, the following must hold:

- The function \( G \) must be **continuous** on the domain \( D \).
- The domain \( D \) must be **invariant** under \( G \), meaning \( G(\mathbf{x}) \in D \) for all \( \mathbf{x} \in D \).
- The **partial derivatives** of the components of \( G \) must be bounded by a constant \( K < 1 \) (this is the contraction condition).

If these conditions are met, the iteration:

\[
\mathbf{x}^{(k)} = G(\mathbf{x}^{(k-1)})
\]

will converge to the unique fixed point \( \mathbf{p} \).


### 5. ‚ö° Accelerating Convergence: Gauss-Seidel Method

The basic fixed-point iteration uses the previous iteration vector \( \mathbf{x}^{(k-1)} \) to compute the next \( \mathbf{x}^{(k)} \). The **Gauss-Seidel method** improves on this by using the most recent updated values within the same iteration step.

For example, when computing \( x_2^{(k)} \), instead of using \( x_1^{(k-1)} \), use the newly computed \( x_1^{(k)} \). This often speeds up convergence because it incorporates the latest information immediately.


### 6. üßÆ Newton's Method for Nonlinear Systems

While fixed-point iteration is useful, it often requires explicitly solving each equation for one variable, which is not always possible. **Newton's method** provides a more general and powerful approach.

#### Idea Behind Newton's Method

Newton's method aims to find the root of \( F(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} \) by iteratively improving guesses \( \mathbf{x}^{(k)} \) using the Jacobian matrix \( J(\mathbf{x}) \), which contains all first-order partial derivatives of \( F \):

\[
J(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_n}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

At each iteration, Newton's method solves the linear system:

\[
J(\mathbf{x}^{(k-1)}) \mathbf{y}^{(k-1)} = -F(\mathbf{x}^{(k-1)})
\]

and updates:

\[
\mathbf{x}^{(k)} = \mathbf{x}^{(k-1)} + \mathbf{y}^{(k-1)}
\]

This process is repeated until convergence.

#### Why Newton's Method?

- It has **quadratic convergence**, meaning the error decreases very rapidly once close to the solution.
- It does **not require explicit fixed-point forms**.
- It uses the Jacobian matrix to approximate the nonlinear system locally by a linear one.


### 7. üß© The Jacobian Matrix and Its Role

The **Jacobian matrix** \( J(\mathbf{x}) \) is central to Newton's method. It generalizes the derivative to multiple variables and functions.

- Each entry \( J_{ij}(\mathbf{x}) \) is the partial derivative of the \( i \)-th function with respect to the \( j \)-th variable.
- The Jacobian tells us how the system changes near a point \( \mathbf{x} \).
- Newton's method requires \( J(\mathbf{x}) \) to be **nonsingular** (invertible) near the solution to solve the linear system.


### 8. üìù Example: Applying Newton's Method

Consider the system:

\[
\begin{cases}
f_1(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 3x_1 - \cos(x_2 x_3) - 1 = 0 \\
f_2(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 81(x_2 + 0.1)^2 + \sin x_3 + 1.06 = 0 \\
f_3(x_1, x_2, x_3) = \text{(some nonlinear function)} = 0
\end{cases}
\]

- Start with an initial guess \( \mathbf{x}^{(0)} = (0.1, 0.1, -0.1)^T \).
- Compute \( F(\mathbf{x}^{(0)}) \) and \( J(\mathbf{x}^{(0)}) \).
- Solve \( J(\mathbf{x}^{(0)}) \mathbf{y}^{(0)} = -F(\mathbf{x}^{(0)}) \) for \( \mathbf{y}^{(0)} \).
- Update \( \mathbf{x}^{(1)} = \mathbf{x}^{(0)} + \mathbf{y}^{(0)} \).
- Repeat until \( \mathbf{x}^{(k)} \) converges.

This method converges quickly once the initial guess is close enough to the true solution.


### Summary

- Nonlinear systems can be expressed as vector functions \( F(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0} \).
- Fixed points \( \mathbf{x} = G(\mathbf{x}) \) provide a way to solve nonlinear systems iteratively.
- The Fixed-Point Theorem guarantees existence and uniqueness under certain conditions.
- Gauss-Seidel iteration can speed up convergence by using updated values immediately.
- Newton's method uses the Jacobian matrix to achieve quadratic convergence without needing explicit fixed-point forms.
- The Jacobian matrix is essential for understanding and applying Newton's method.
- Practical application involves iteratively solving linear systems derived from the Jacobian and function values.
