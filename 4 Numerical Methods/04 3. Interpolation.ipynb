       "### 1. üß© What is Interpolation and Why Use Cubic Splines?\n",
       "\n",
       "**Interpolation** is a method used to estimate values between known data points. Imagine you have a set of points on a graph, and you want to draw a smooth curve that passes exactly through all these points. This curve is called an **interpolating function**.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Cubic spline interpolation** is a popular technique where the interpolating function is made up of several cubic polynomials, each defined on a small interval between two consecutive data points. Instead of fitting one big polynomial to all points (which can oscillate wildly), cubic splines fit smaller cubic polynomials piecewise, ensuring smoothness and continuity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Why cubic splines? Because they provide a smooth curve that not only passes through the data points but also has continuous first and second derivatives, making the curve look natural and smooth‚Äîlike a flexible rod bent through the points.\n",
