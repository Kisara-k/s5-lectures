       "### 1. üîÑ Recap of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\n",
       "\n",
       "To understand the advanced concepts in this lecture, let's first revisit the basics of RNNs.\n",
       "\n",
       "RNNs are a type of neural network designed specifically for **sequential data** ‚Äî data where the order of inputs matters, such as text, speech, or time series. Unlike traditional neural networks that treat inputs independently, RNNs **remember information from previous inputs** to influence the current output. This memory is stored in what we call the **hidden state**.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Why do we need RNNs for sequences?\n",
       "\n",
       "When analyzing sequences, the current input often depends on previous inputs. For example, in language, the meaning of a word depends on the words before it. To capture this, RNNs use **recursion** ‚Äî they process data step-by-step, passing information forward through time.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### How do RNNs work mathematically?\n",
       "\n",
       "At each time step $ t $, the RNN updates its hidden state $ h_t $ based on the current input $ x_t $ and the previous hidden state $ h_{t-1} $:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$\n",
       "h_t = \\tanh(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t)\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "Here, $ W_h $ and $ W_x $ are weight matrices learned during training, and $ \\tanh $ is a nonlinear activation function that squashes values between -1 and 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "The output probability for the next element in the sequence $ y_{t+1} $ is computed using a softmax function:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$\n",
       "P(y_{t+1}) = \\text{Softmax}(W_y h_t)\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "The hidden state $ h_t $ acts as a **summary of all past inputs** up to time $ t $. The initial hidden state $ h_0 $ is usually set to zero or learned.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Types of RNN architectures\n",
       "\n",
       "- **One-to-Many:** One input, multiple outputs (e.g., image captioning).\n",
       "- **Many-to-One:** Multiple inputs, one output (e.g., sentiment analysis).\n",
       "- **Many-to-Many:** Multiple inputs, multiple outputs (e.g., machine translation).\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Bidirectional RNNs\n",
       "\n",
       "Sometimes, the output at time $ t $ depends not only on past inputs but also on future inputs. For example, in speech recognition, understanding a sound might require knowing the next few sounds. **Bidirectional RNNs** address this by processing the sequence both forward and backward, combining information from past and future.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Gradient Problems in RNNs: Vanishing and Exploding Gradients\n",
       "\n",
       "Training RNNs involves backpropagation through time (BPTT), where gradients are propagated backward through many time steps. However, this process often suffers from two major problems:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Vanishing gradients:** Gradients become very small as they are multiplied repeatedly through time steps, causing the network to stop learning long-range dependencies.\n",
       "- **Exploding gradients:** Gradients grow exponentially large, causing unstable updates.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mathematically, the gradient of the loss with respect to weights involves a product of many terms like $ \\frac{\\partial h_t}{\\partial h_{t-1}} $, which can be less than 1 (leading to vanishing) or greater than 1 (leading to exploding).\n",
       "\n",
       "This limits vanilla RNNs' ability to learn from long sequences because the influence of early inputs fades away or becomes unstable.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. üß† Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks\n",
       "\n",
       "To solve the gradient problems, **LSTM networks** were introduced. LSTMs are a special kind of RNN designed to **remember information for long periods** and **allow gradients to flow more easily** during training.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### What makes LSTMs different?\n",
       "\n",
       "Unlike vanilla RNNs that use a single layer with a simple tanh activation, LSTMs have a more complex repeating module with **four interacting layers** and **gates** that control the flow of information.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### The key component: Cell State\n",
       "\n",
       "The LSTM introduces a **cell state** $ C_t $, which acts like a conveyor belt running through the sequence with only minor linear interactions. This design allows information to flow unchanged unless explicitly modified, enabling the network to maintain long-term memory.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Gates in LSTM\n",
       "\n",
       "Gates are sigmoid-activated layers that output values between 0 and 1, deciding how much information to let through. There are three main gates:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Forget gate:** Decides what information to discard from the cell state.\n",
       "- **Input gate:** Decides what new information to add to the cell state.\n",
       "- **Output gate:** Decides what information from the cell state to output as the hidden state.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. üîç Step-by-Step Walkthrough of LSTM Operation\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's understand how an LSTM processes information using a simple example:\n",
       "\n",
       "> \"Saman studies at UOM. His sister studies at UOC. She studies law.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Step 1: Forget Gate\n",
       "\n",
       "The forget gate looks at the previous hidden state $ h_{t-1} $ and the current input $ x_t $ and outputs a number between 0 and 1 for each element in the previous cell state $ C_{t-1} $. A value of 1 means \"keep this information,\" and 0 means \"forget it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, when the LSTM sees the word \"sister,\" it might decide to forget information related to \"Saman\" because the focus shifts.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Step 2: Input Gate and Candidate Values\n",
       "\n",
       "The input gate decides which new information to add to the cell state. It works together with a **tanh layer** that creates a vector of candidate values $ \\tilde{C}_t $ that could be added.\n",
       "\n",
       "In our example, the LSTM might add the gender information of \"sister\" to replace the old information it is forgetting.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Step 3: Update Cell State\n",
       "\n",
       "The new cell state $ C_t $ is updated by combining the old cell state filtered by the forget gate and the new candidate values filtered by the input gate:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$\n",
       "C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \\tilde{C}_t\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "This additive update helps maintain gradient flow and long-term memory.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Step 4: Output Gate and Hidden State\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, the output gate decides what part of the cell state to output as the hidden state $ h_t $:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$\n",
       "h_t = o_t * \\tanh(C_t)\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "The $ \\tanh $ function filters the cell state to highlight significant information (values close to ¬±1) and suppress minor details (values near 0).\n",
       "\n",
       "In the example, after processing \"sister,\" the LSTM might output whether the subject is singular or plural, which is useful for downstream tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. üîÑ Gradient Flow in LSTM\n",
       "\n",
       "Thanks to the additive nature of the cell state updates, LSTMs allow gradients to flow more smoothly through time, avoiding the vanishing gradient problem that plagues vanilla RNNs.\n",
       "\n",
       "The gradient of the loss with respect to the weights involves terms like:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\\frac{\\partial C_t}{\\partial C_{t-1}} = A_t + B_t + D_t + E_t\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "This complex but stable gradient flow enables LSTMs to learn long-term dependencies effectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. üîÄ Variants of LSTM: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\n",
       "\n",
       "Another popular variant of LSTM is the **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**, which simplifies the LSTM architecture by:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Combining the forget and input gates into a single **update gate** $ z_t $.\n",
       "- Merging the cell state and hidden state into one.\n",
       "- Using a **reset gate** $ r_t $ to control how much past information to forget.\n",
       "\n",
       "GRUs have fewer parameters and often train faster than LSTMs, while achieving similar performance on many tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 7. üîç Beam Search: Improving Sequence Generation\n",
       "\n",
       "When generating sequences (like text), simply picking the most likely next word at each step can lead to suboptimal results. **Beam search** is a heuristic search algorithm that keeps track of multiple candidate sequences (beams) at each step, exploring several possibilities before choosing the best overall sequence.\n",
       "\n",
       "This approach balances between greedy search (fast but shortsighted) and exhaustive search (slow but thorough), improving the quality of generated sequences.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 8. üéØ Attention Mechanism: Focusing on Important Parts\n",
       "\n",
       "RNNs and LSTMs try to encode the entire input sequence into a fixed-size hidden state, which can be problematic for long sequences. The **attention mechanism** addresses this by allowing the model to focus on specific parts of the input when generating each output.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### How does attention work?\n",
       "\n",
       "For each output word $ y_j $, the model computes a set of **attention weights** $ \\alpha_{ij} $ that indicate how much attention to pay to each input hidden state $ h_i $. These weights are normalized to sum to 1 and are used to compute a **context vector** $ C_j $, a weighted sum of the input states:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$\n",
       "C_j = \\sum_i \\alpha_{ij} h_i\n",
       "$$\n",
       "\n",
       "This context vector helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input when producing each output word.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Computing attention weights\n",
       "\n",
       "Attention weights are computed using a small neural network (often a feedforward network) that scores the relevance of each input hidden state to the current output step. The scores are passed through a softmax to get normalized weights.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Example: Machine Translation\n",
       "\n",
       "When translating a sentence from English to French, instead of encoding the entire English sentence into one vector, the attention mechanism allows the model to look at different English words when generating each French word, improving translation quality, especially for long sentences.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 9. ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of LSTM and the Rise of Transformers\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite their strengths, LSTMs have some limitations:\n",
       "\n",
       "- They struggle with **very long sequences** because even with gates, the memory is limited.\n",
       "- They cannot be trained in parallel efficiently because of their sequential nature.\n",
       "\n",
       "To overcome these issues, newer architectures like **Transformers** have been developed. Transformers rely entirely on attention mechanisms and allow for parallel processing of sequences, leading to state-of-the-art performance in many sequence modeling tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "## Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "- RNNs are designed for sequential data but suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients.\n",
       "- LSTMs solve these problems using cell states and gates to control information flow.\n",
       "- GRUs simplify LSTMs with fewer gates and parameters.\n",
       "- Beam search improves sequence generation by exploring multiple candidate outputs.\n",
       "- Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant parts of the input, improving performance on long sequences.\n",
       "- Transformers are the next step beyond LSTMs, enabling parallel training and better handling of long sequences.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "If you want, I can also provide diagrams or code examples to further clarify these concepts!\n",
       "\n",
       "## Questions\n",

       "**Explanation:**  \n",
       "- (A) Vanilla RNNs maintain a hidden state that summarizes past inputs, enabling sequential data processing.  \n",
       "- (C) They suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients during training, limiting their ability to learn long-term dependencies.  \n",

       "**Correct:** A  \n",
       "**Explanation:**  \n",
       "The hidden state depends on the current input $ x_t $ and the previous hidden state $ h_{t-1} $. It does not depend solely on $ x_t $ or the output at $ t-1 $, and vanilla RNNs do not have a cell state $ C_t $.\n",
