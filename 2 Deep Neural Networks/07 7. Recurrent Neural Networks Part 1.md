## 7. Recurrent Neural Networks Part 1

Certainly! Below is a detailed, well-organized study note based on the lecture content you provided about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The explanations are clear and thorough, designed to help you understand the key concepts step-by-step. I’ve used emojis and numbered main headings for clarity and structure.



## Study Notes: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Part 1 📚



### 1. 🔄 Introduction to Sequences and Why They Matter

Sequences are everywhere in the world around us. A **sequence** is simply a collection of elements arranged in a specific order, where:

- Elements can repeat.
- The order of elements is important.
- The length of the sequence can vary and sometimes be very long or even infinite.

#### Why do sequences matter?

Think about everyday examples:

- Sentences: “I will go home after I finish my work.” The order of words matters to convey meaning.
- Speech: Sounds come in a sequence to form words.
- Videos: Frames appear in a sequence to show motion.
- Medical records: Patient data over time forms a sequence.
- Programs: Instructions executed in order.

Because sequences are so common, learning how to model and understand them is crucial for many applications in AI and machine learning.



### 2. 🧠 Limitations of Traditional Neural Networks for Sequences

Before RNNs, we mainly used:

- **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)**: Feed-forward networks that take fixed-size inputs.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Great for images but not designed for sequences.

**Problem:** These networks expect fixed-size, static inputs and do not handle sequences well because:

- They do not consider the order or context of elements.
- They cannot process variable-length sequences naturally.

For example, a feed-forward network cannot easily understand that the word “bank” means different things in “river bank” vs. “money bank” because it lacks context.



### 3. 📊 Sequence Modeling: Challenges and Traditional Approaches

Modeling sequences means predicting the next element based on previous elements. For example, predicting the next word in a sentence.

#### Why is this hard?

- Words depend on context, which can be long and complex.
- Simple models assume independence between words, which is unrealistic.
- Example: A naive model might output “The the the the...” because it doesn’t understand context.

#### Traditional fix: N-grams

- N-grams look at only the previous N words to predict the next word.
- This limits context to a small window.
- The data table for all possible N-grams becomes huge and sparse.
- It still cannot capture long-range dependencies.



### 4. 🔁 What Are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)?

RNNs are designed specifically to handle sequences by maintaining a **persistent state** that carries information from previous elements.

#### How do RNNs work?

At each time step \( t \), the RNN:

- Takes the current input \( x_t \) (e.g., the current word or character).
- Combines it with the previous hidden state \( h_{t-1} \), which stores information from all previous inputs.
- Updates the hidden state \( h_t \) using a function like:

\[
h_t = \tanh(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t)
\]

Here:

- \( W_h \) and \( W_x \) are weight matrices.
- \( \tanh \) is a nonlinear activation function that helps the network learn complex patterns.

The hidden state \( h_t \) acts like a memory that summarizes the sequence seen so far.

#### Predicting the next element

The RNN uses the hidden state to predict the next output \( y_{t+1} \):

\[
P(y_{t+1}) = \text{Softmax}(W_y h_t)
\]

- The softmax function converts raw scores into probabilities over all possible next words.
- This allows the RNN to output a probability distribution for the next word or character.



### 5. 🏋️‍♂️ Training RNNs: Learning from Sequences

#### Training process

- We provide the RNN with sequences (e.g., sentences or character strings).
- The RNN predicts the next element at each time step.
- We compare the prediction with the actual next element using **cross-entropy loss**, which measures how well the predicted probabilities match the true data.

For one word at time \( t \):

\[
\mathcal{L}_t = - y_t \log \hat{y}_t
\]

For the whole sequence:

\[
\mathcal{L} = - \sum_t y_t \log \hat{y}_t
\]

where \( y_t \) is the true label and \( \hat{y}_t \) is the predicted probability.

#### Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

- The RNN is “unfolded” over time steps, creating a computational graph.
- We perform forward passes through the entire sequence to compute loss.
- Then, we backpropagate errors through all time steps to update weights.
- This process is called **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**.



### 6. 🔄 RNNs in Action: Examples and Inference

#### Character-level language model example

- Vocabulary: [h, e, l, o]
- Training sequence: “hello”

The RNN learns to predict the next character given the previous ones.

#### Inference (generating sequences)

- At test time, the RNN generates one character at a time.
- The output character is fed back as input for the next prediction.
- This process continues to generate sequences of arbitrary length.



### 7. 🔢 Different Sequence Processing Modes of RNNs

RNNs can handle sequences in different ways depending on the task:

- **One-to-Many:** One input vector produces a sequence output.  
  *Example:* Image captioning (one image → sequence of words).

- **Many-to-One:** A sequence input is summarized into one output.  
  *Example:* Sentiment analysis (sequence of words → sentiment label).

- **Many-to-Many:** Sequence input produces sequence output.  
  *Example:* Machine translation (sequence of words in one language → sequence of words in another).



### 8. 👍 Advantages of Vanilla RNNs

- Can process sequences of any length.
- Maintain historical context through hidden states.
- Capture short-range dependencies effectively.
- Model size remains fixed regardless of input length.
- Shared weights across time steps reduce the number of parameters, improving generalization.



### 9. 👎 Disadvantages and Challenges of Vanilla RNNs

- **Slow computation:** Sequential processing limits parallelization.
- **No future context:** RNNs only use past inputs, not future ones.
- **Vanishing and exploding gradients:** During training, gradients can become very small or very large, making learning difficult.



### 10. ⚠️ Understanding Gradient Flow and Problems in RNNs

#### Gradient flow in RNNs

- Gradients are propagated backward through time during training.
- The gradient at time \( t \) depends on repeated multiplication by the weight matrix \( W_h \) and derivatives of the activation function.
- This repeated multiplication can cause:

  - **Exploding gradients:** When the largest singular value of \( W_h \) > 1, gradients grow exponentially.
  - **Vanishing gradients:** When the largest singular value < 1, gradients shrink exponentially.

#### Why is this a problem?

- **Vanishing gradients** make it hard for the RNN to learn long-term dependencies because the influence of earlier inputs fades away.
- **Exploding gradients** cause unstable training and large updates that can ruin the model.



### 11. 🛠️ Solutions to Gradient Problems in RNNs

#### For Exploding Gradients

- **Truncated Backpropagation:** Limit backpropagation to a fixed number of time steps instead of the entire sequence. This reduces computation but may miss long-term dependencies.
- **Gradient Clipping:** Set a maximum threshold for gradients. If gradients exceed this, they are scaled down to prevent instability.

#### For Vanishing Gradients

- **Weight Initialization:** Carefully initialize weights to keep gradient magnitudes stable.
- **Advanced Architectures:** Use specialized RNN variants like **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, which have mechanisms to preserve gradients over long sequences.
