## Study Notes on Generative Models  
*Based on lecture by Dr. Sandareka Wickramanayake*



### 1. üß† Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

When we talk about machine learning, there are two broad categories: **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. Understanding the difference between these is fundamental before diving into generative models.

#### Supervised Learning  
In supervised learning, the dataset consists of pairs of inputs and outputs, denoted as (x, y). Here, **x** is the input data (like an image or text), and **y** is the label or target (like the category of the image). The goal is to learn a function \( f(x) = y \) that maps inputs to their correct labels.

- **Examples:**  
  - Classification (e.g., identifying if an image contains a cat or dog)  
  - Regression (predicting continuous values like house prices)  
  - Object detection (finding and labeling objects in images)  
  - Semantic segmentation (labeling each pixel in an image)  
  - Image captioning (generating a descriptive sentence for an image)

In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled data, which means it knows the "right answers" during training.

#### Unsupervised Learning  
In unsupervised learning, the dataset contains only inputs \( x \) without any labels. The goal here is to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data without explicit guidance.

- **Examples:**  
  - Clustering (grouping similar data points)  
  - Dimensionality reduction (simplifying data while preserving important information)  
  - Density estimation (estimating the probability distribution that generated the data)

**Density estimation** is particularly important for generative models. It involves reconstructing the probability density function \( P_{data}(x) \) from observed data points \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \). Essentially, we want to understand how likely different data points are, based on the training data.



### 2. ‚öîÔ∏è Discriminative vs Generative Models

Machine learning models can also be categorized based on what they learn about the data.

#### Discriminative Models  
These models learn the boundary or decision function between classes. They model the conditional probability \( P(y|x) \), meaning they predict the label \( y \) given the input \( x \).

- **Examples:** Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), traditional neural networks (CNNs, RNNs), Conditional Random Fields.

#### Generative Models  
Generative models learn the joint probability distribution \( P(x, y) \) or just \( P(x) \) in unsupervised settings. Their goal is to model how the data itself is generated, allowing them to create new data samples similar to the training data.

- **Examples:** Na√Øve Bayes, Bayesian networks, Hidden Markov Models, and modern deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).



### 3. üé≤ What Are Generative Models?

Generative models aim to **learn the underlying distribution of the training data** so that they can generate new, realistic samples from that distribution.

- Given training data sampled from \( P_{data}(x) \), the model tries to learn \( P_{model}(x) \approx P_{data}(x) \).
- Once trained, the model can **sample new data points** \( x \) from \( P_{model}(x) \).

There are two main approaches to generative modeling:

- **Explicit density estimation:** The model explicitly defines and learns the probability distribution \( P_{model}(x) \).
- **Implicit density estimation:** The model learns to generate samples from \( P_{model}(x) \) without explicitly defining the distribution.

#### Why Use Generative Models?  
Generative models have many practical uses:

- Creating realistic images, artwork, or videos  
- Enhancing images (super-resolution, colorization)  
- Learning useful features for other tasks like classification  
- Understanding complex, high-dimensional data in fields like physics or medical imaging  
- Simulating environments for robotics and reinforcement learning



### 4. üß© Autoencoders: Learning Compact Representations

An **autoencoder** is a type of neural network used in unsupervised learning to compress data into a lower-dimensional space and then reconstruct it back.

- The network has two parts:  
  - **Encoder:** Compresses input data \( x \) into a smaller latent representation \( z \).  
  - **Decoder:** Reconstructs the original data from \( z \).

The latent space \( z \) is usually much smaller than the input \( x \), forcing the model to learn meaningful features that capture the essential factors of variation in the data.

#### Key Points About Autoencoders  
- They are trained to minimize the difference between the input and the reconstructed output, often using an L2 loss (mean squared error).  
- Autoencoders do **not** require labels, making them unsupervised.  
- They are **not generative models** because they do not learn a probability distribution over \( z \); they just learn to compress and reconstruct.  
- After training, the encoder part can be used to initialize supervised models, helping with transfer learning when labeled data is scarce.

#### Variations  
- **Denoising autoencoders:** Trained to reconstruct clean data from noisy inputs, useful for noise removal.  
- **Deep autoencoders:** Use multiple layers and nonlinearities (ReLU, sigmoid) for better feature extraction.  
- **Convolutional autoencoders:** Use convolutional layers, especially for image data.



### 5. üîÑ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Making Autoencoders Generative

To turn an autoencoder into a generative model, we need to model the **distribution of the latent space** \( z \).

#### How VAEs Work  
- Assume each data point \( x^{(i)} \) is generated from a latent variable \( z \) sampled from a prior distribution (usually a Gaussian).  
- The encoder learns an approximate posterior distribution \( Q_\phi(z|x) \), which outputs parameters \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \) of a Gaussian distribution for \( z \).  
- The decoder learns \( P_\theta(x|z) \), reconstructing \( x \) from \( z \).

#### The Reparameterization Trick  
To allow backpropagation through the sampling step, VAEs use the reparameterization trick:

\[
z = \mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
\]

This separates the randomness from the parameters, enabling gradient-based optimization.

#### Training Objective  
VAEs maximize a lower bound on the data likelihood, balancing two goals:

- Reconstruct the input well (high likelihood of \( x \) given \( z \))  
- Keep the approximate posterior \( Q_\phi(z|x) \) close to the prior \( P(z) \) (usually a standard normal distribution)

#### Benefits of VAEs  
- They are **explicit density models**, meaning they learn a probability distribution over data.  
- They can generate new samples by sampling \( z \) from the prior and decoding it.  
- They can learn **disentangled representations**, where different dimensions of \( z \) correspond to interpretable features (e.g., smile intensity, head pose in faces).



### 6. üé≠ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Learning by Competition

GANs are a powerful class of generative models that learn to generate realistic data by setting up a **two-player game** between two neural networks:

- **Generator (G):** Takes random noise \( z \) as input and tries to generate fake data samples that look like the real data.  
- **Discriminator (D):** Tries to distinguish between real data samples and fake samples produced by the generator.

#### How GANs Work  
- The generator learns a transformation from a simple distribution (e.g., Gaussian noise) to the complex data distribution.  
- The discriminator outputs a probability indicating whether a given sample is real or fake.  
- Both networks are trained simultaneously:  
  - The discriminator tries to maximize its accuracy in telling real from fake.  
  - The generator tries to fool the discriminator by producing more realistic samples.

This setup is called a **minimax game** because the generator tries to minimize the discriminator‚Äôs success, while the discriminator tries to maximize it.

#### Training Objective  
- Discriminator wants \( D(x) \approx 1 \) for real data and \( D(G(z)) \approx 0 \) for fake data.  
- Generator wants \( D(G(z)) \approx 1 \), fooling the discriminator.

#### After Training  
Once trained, the generator can produce new, realistic samples by feeding it random noise vectors.



### 7. üèóÔ∏è GAN Architectures and Improvements

#### Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs)  
- Use convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers for better image generation.  
- Replace pooling layers with strided convolutions (discriminator) and fractional-strided convolutions (generator).  
- Use batch normalization in both networks for stable training.  
- Use ReLU activations in the generator (except output uses Tanh) and LeakyReLU in the discriminator.

#### Progressive GANs  
- Start training with low-resolution images and progressively increase resolution.  
- This approach improves image quality, training stability, and diversity of generated samples.



### Summary

Generative models are a fascinating area of machine learning focused on understanding and recreating the data distribution. They differ from discriminative models by modeling the data itself rather than just the boundaries between classes.

- **Autoencoders** learn compressed representations but are not generative by default.  
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** extend autoencoders to be generative by modeling latent distributions explicitly.  
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** use a game between two networks to implicitly learn to generate realistic data.

These models have broad applications, from image synthesis to scientific data analysis, and continue to be an active research area.
