## Study Notes on Neural Networks and Back Propagation



### 1. üß† Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are inspired by the biological networks of neurons found in animal brains, especially humans. The human brain contains about a trillion neurons, which are specialized cells that process and transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. Understanding these biological neurons helps us design artificial neural networks that can solve complex problems in machine learning.

#### What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is essentially a system made up of many interconnected neurons. In biology, these neurons communicate through connections called synapses. Artificial neural networks mimic this structure by connecting simple computational units (artificial neurons) with weighted links.

#### Biological Neurons: The Basics

- **Neuron**: The fundamental unit of the nervous system, a neuron receives inputs from other neurons and produces an output signal if certain conditions are met.
- **Signal Transmission**: Neurons receive electrical signals at their dendrites, which come from the axon terminals of other neurons. These signals cross a tiny gap called the synaptic cleft.
- **Synaptic Strength (Weight)**: The amount of signal passed depends on the synapse's strength, modeled as a weight (w) in artificial neurons.
- **Weighted Sum**: The neuron sums all incoming signals multiplied by their respective weights.
- **Firing**: If this weighted sum exceeds a threshold, the neuron fires, sending an action potential (voltage spike) down its axon.
- **Types of Synapses**:
  - **Excitatory Synapses**: Increase the likelihood of firing (modeled with positive weights).
  - **Inhibitory Synapses**: Decrease the likelihood of firing (modeled with negative weights).



### 2. ü§ñ Models of Artificial Neurons

Artificial neurons are simplified mathematical models inspired by biological neurons. They take multiple inputs, apply weights, sum them, and produce an output based on an activation function.

#### Common Types of Artificial Neurons

- **Binary Threshold Neuron (McCulloch-Pitts Model)**  
  This neuron outputs either 0 or 1 depending on whether the weighted sum of inputs exceeds a threshold.  
  Formula:  
  \[
  \text{Output} = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } z \geq \text{threshold} \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \quad \text{where } z = \sum x_i w_i
  \]

- **Rectified Linear Neuron (ReLU)**  
  Outputs the weighted sum if it is positive, otherwise outputs zero. This is a simple linear threshold function.

- **Sigmoid Neuron**  
  Uses the sigmoid (logistic) function to produce a smooth output between 0 and 1. This continuous output is differentiable, which is useful for learning algorithms.  
  Sigmoid function:  
  \[
  \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
  \]



### 3. üï∏Ô∏è Simple Artificial Neural Networks

A basic neural network consists of layers of neurons:

- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data.
- **Hidden Layer(s)**: Intermediate layers that transform inputs into useful features.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or classification.

For example, a simple feed-forward network with one hidden layer takes inputs, processes them through weighted connections and activation functions, and outputs results.



### 4. üéØ Why Study Neural Networks?

Neural networks are studied for two main reasons:

1. **Understanding the Brain**:  
   Although the brain is extremely complex, simplified neural networks help us model and understand some aspects of brain function.

2. **Solving Practical Problems**:  
   Artificial neural networks are powerful tools for machine learning tasks such as:
   - Visual object recognition (e.g., identifying objects in images)
   - Handwritten digit recognition (e.g., reading postal codes)
   - Speech recognition
   - Classification, prediction, and clustering problems



### 5. üîç A Simple Pattern Recognition Example

Imagine a 3x3 grid (dot-matrix display) that can show different patterns, including letters like "T" and "L". Each cell in the grid is represented by a binary variable \( x_i \) where:

- \( x_i = 1 \) if the cell is shaded
- \( x_i = 0 \) if the cell is blank

Using a neural network with weighted connections and binary threshold neurons, we can train the network to recognize whether the pattern corresponds to "T" or "L". The network sums the weighted inputs and compares them to thresholds to decide the output.



### 6. üß© Perceptron and Learning

#### What is a Perceptron?

A perceptron is a simple type of artificial neuron used for binary classification. It tries to separate data points into two classes by finding a linear boundary (a line or hyperplane).

#### Perceptron Learning Algorithm

- **Goal**: Find weights \( w \) such that the perceptron correctly classifies all training data.
- **Assumption**: The data is linearly separable (can be separated by a straight line or hyperplane).
- **How it works**:
  - Initialize weights randomly.
  - For each misclassified data point:
    - If a positive example is misclassified as negative, adjust weights to move the decision boundary closer to that point.
    - If a negative example is misclassified as positive, adjust weights to move the boundary away.
- This iterative process continues until all points are correctly classified or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

#### Limitations

- If data is **not linearly separable**, the perceptron algorithm will not converge.



### 7. üß∞ The Pocket Algorithm

To handle non-linearly separable data, the **pocket algorithm** is used:

- It keeps track of the best weight vector found so far (the one with the fewest misclassifications).
- Continues updating weights using the perceptron learning rule.
- Updates the "pocket" weight vector only if a better solution is found.
- This provides an approximate solution even when perfect separation is impossible.



### 8. üìä Performance of Neural Networks in Machine Learning

#### Image Recognition (ImageNet Challenge)

- ImageNet is a large dataset with 1.3 million images across 1000 object classes.
- Early systems had high error rates (~47% for top choice).
- Deep neural networks (e.g., Krizhevsky et al., 2012) significantly improved performance, reducing error rates to below 40% for the top choice and below 20% for the top 5 choices.

#### Speech Recognition

- Speech recognition systems convert sound waves into acoustic feature vectors.
- Deep neural networks have replaced older models (like Gaussian Mixture Models) for acoustic modeling.
- They achieve lower word error rates, improving accuracy significantly with more training data.



### 9. üîÑ Back Propagation for Supervised Learning

#### What is Back Propagation?

Back propagation is a method used to train multilayer neural networks by minimizing the error between predicted outputs and actual outputs.

#### How Does It Work?

- The network computes outputs for given inputs.
- The error (difference between predicted and desired outputs) is calculated.
- This error is propagated backward through the network to update weights.
- The goal is to adjust weights to minimize the error using **gradient descent**.

#### Gradient Descent

- A numerical optimization technique that iteratively adjusts weights to reduce error.
- Moves weights in the direction opposite to the gradient of the error function (downhill).
- Requires calculating partial derivatives of the error with respect to each weight.



### 10. üî¢ Chain Rule and Modular Back Propagation

#### Chain Rule of Differentiation

Back propagation uses the chain rule to compute gradients efficiently:

- If a function \( z \) depends on intermediate variables \( u \) and \( v \), which in turn depend on \( x \) and \( y \), the derivative of \( z \) with respect to \( x \) is computed by summing the derivatives through each path.

#### Modular Approach

- The network is viewed as a series of modules (layers).
- Each module computes outputs and passes forward.
- During back propagation, error signals are passed backward through these modules.
- This modularity simplifies the calculation of gradients for complex networks.



### 11. ‚öôÔ∏è Example of Back Propagation in a Simple Network

Consider a network with:

- Inputs \( x_1, x_2 \)
- One hidden layer neuron
- Output neuron with sigmoid activation

The error function \( E \) is typically the squared difference between predicted output \( z \) and desired output \( d \):

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} (z - d)^2
\]

Back propagation calculates:

- The derivative of \( E \) with respect to each weight.
- Uses the sigmoid derivative \( \sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z)) \).
- Updates weights by moving opposite to the gradient.
