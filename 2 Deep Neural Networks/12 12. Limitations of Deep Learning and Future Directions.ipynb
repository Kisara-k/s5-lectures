       "### 1. ü§î Introduction to Deep Learning Limitations\n",
       "\n",
       "Deep learning, especially through Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has revolutionized many fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. These models can learn complex patterns from data and often outperform traditional machine learning methods. However, despite their impressive capabilities, deep learning models are not perfect. They come with several important limitations that affect their reliability, usability, and deployment in real-world applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "Understanding these limitations is crucial for researchers, practitioners, and students because it helps us recognize where deep learning might fail or need improvement. It also guides future research directions to make these models more robust, efficient, and trustworthy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. üöß Key Limitations of Deep Neural Networks\n",
       "\n",
       "Let‚Äôs explore the main challenges and limitations that deep neural networks face:\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 2.1 Lack of Explainability\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the biggest issues with deep learning models is that they are often considered \"black boxes.\" This means:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **What happens inside the model is not transparent.** The model learns millions of parameters, but it‚Äôs very difficult to understand why it makes a particular decision.\n",
       "- This lack of explainability makes it hard to trust the model, especially in critical areas like healthcare, finance, or legal systems where understanding the reasoning behind a decision is essential.\n",
       "- Without clear explanations, debugging or improving models becomes challenging.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 2.2 Requirement for Large Amounts of Data\n",
       "\n",
       "Deep learning models typically need **massive datasets** to perform well:\n",
       "\n",
       "- They learn by example, so the more data they have, the better they can generalize.\n",
       "- In many real-world scenarios, collecting such large datasets is expensive, time-consuming, or even impossible.\n",
       "- Small datasets often lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data but fails to perform well on new, unseen data.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 2.3 Vulnerability to Adversarial Attacks\n",
       "\n",
       "Deep neural networks are surprisingly fragile when faced with adversarial attacks:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Adversarial attacks involve making tiny, often imperceptible changes to input data (like images or text) that cause the model to make wrong predictions.\n",
       "- For example, a small change to a stop sign image might cause an autonomous car‚Äôs vision system to misclassify it as a speed limit sign.\n",
       "- This vulnerability raises serious safety and security concerns, especially in applications like self-driving cars, facial recognition, and cybersecurity.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 2.4 High Computational Resource Requirements\n",
       "\n",
       "Training and running deep learning models require significant computational power:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Deep networks often have millions or billions of parameters, demanding powerful GPUs or specialized hardware.\n",
       "- This leads to high energy consumption and costs, which can be a barrier for smaller organizations or individuals.\n",
       "- It also limits the deployment of deep learning models on devices with limited resources, such as smartphones or embedded systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 2.5 Privacy Issues\n",
       "\n",
       "Deep learning models can raise privacy concerns:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Training data often contains sensitive personal information.\n",
       "- Models can unintentionally memorize and leak private data, especially if not properly designed.\n",
       "- Sharing models trained on private data can risk exposing confidential information.\n",
       "- This is a critical issue in healthcare, finance, and other domains where data privacy is legally protected.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Group Activity: Exploring Deep Learning Limitations\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "##### 3.1 Activity Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "- Students form groups (as done in a previous lecture on sequential modeling).\n",
       "- Each group is assigned a specific limitation topic related to deep learning.\n",
       "- Groups use provided resources (available on Moodle) to research their topic.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 3.2 Tasks for the Group\n",
       "\n",
       "- Prepare a **short presentation** (maximum 10 slides) covering:\n",
       "  - An introduction to the assigned problem.\n",
       "  - Why this problem is important ‚Äî explaining the real-world implications.\n",
       "  - Existing solutions or approaches to address the problem.\n",
       "- One group member submits the presentation as a PDF to Moodle by the deadline.\n",
       "- The presentation will be graded based on content and clarity.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 3.3 Deadlines\n",
       "\n",
       "- Presentation submission: **24th October 2024, 11:59 PM**\n",
       "- Quiz answering (based on all group presentations and resources): **30th October 2024, 3:15 - 5:15 PM**\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. üìù Quiz and Collaborative Learning\n",
       "\n",
       "After presentations are submitted, students will:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Review presentations from other groups.\n",
       "- Discuss and formulate answers to a quiz based on the topics covered.\n",
       "- Submit the quiz answers as a group.\n",
       "\n",
       "This collaborative approach helps reinforce learning by exposing students to a variety of deep learning limitations and solutions beyond their assigned topic.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. üîÆ Future Directions in Deep Learning\n",
       "\n",
       "While the lecture content primarily focuses on limitations and the group activity, it implicitly points toward future directions:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Improving explainability:** Developing methods to make models more interpretable and transparent.\n",
       "- **Data efficiency:** Creating models that require less data or can learn effectively from smaller datasets.\n",
       "- **Robustness:** Designing models resistant to adversarial attacks and errors.\n",
       "- **Resource optimization:** Building lightweight models that can run on limited hardware with less energy.\n",
       "- **Privacy-preserving techniques:** Using methods like federated learning or differential privacy to protect sensitive data.\n",
       "\n",
       "These directions are active research areas aiming to overcome current challenges and make deep learning more practical and trustworthy.\n",

       "##### 17. Which of the following are true about adversarial robustness?  \n",
       "**Correct answers:** A) It refers to a model‚Äôs ability to resist adversarial attacks, C) It is an active area of research in deep learning, D) It can be improved by adversarial training  \n",
       "**Explanation:** Adversarial robustness is about resisting attacks and is actively researched. Adversarial training is one method to improve it.\n",

       "##### 18. Why is it difficult to deploy deep learning models on devices like smartphones?  \n",
       "**Correct answers:** A) Because smartphones lack sufficient computational power, C) Because of privacy concerns with mobile data  \n",
       "**Explanation:** Smartphones have limited hardware and privacy concerns restrict data use. Models do not require datasets on the device itself, and smartphones can run some ML models, so B and D are incorrect.\n",

       "##### 19. Which of the following are challenges when collecting data for deep learning?  \n",
       "**Correct answers:** A) Data labeling can be expensive and time-consuming, B) Data privacy regulations may restrict data use  \n",
       "**Explanation:** Labeling data is costly and privacy laws can limit data availability. Data is not always clean or easy to obtain, so C and D are false.\n",

       "##### 20. Future directions in deep learning research include:  \n",
       "**Correct answers:** A) Developing more explainable models, B) Creating models that require less data, D) Designing lightweight models for resource-limited devices  \n",
       "**Explanation:** Future research focuses on explainability, data efficiency, and lightweight models. Ignoring privacy concerns is not a valid direction.\n",
