## Study Notes on Transformers



### 1. ü§ñ Introduction to Transformers

Transformers are a powerful architecture designed to handle sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and more. Unlike traditional models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), transformers do not rely on processing data sequentially. Instead, they use a mechanism called **self-attention** to understand relationships between all parts of the input data simultaneously. This allows transformers to efficiently capture long-range dependencies in data, making them highly effective for natural language processing (NLP) and other sequential tasks.



### 2. üîÑ Recap: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Before diving into transformers, it‚Äôs important to understand the limitations of RNNs, which were the standard for sequential data processing:

- **Sequential Data Analysis:** When analyzing sequences (like sentences), the model must consider past inputs to understand the current input properly.
- **Recursion for Past Information:** RNNs use recurrent hidden states to remember information from previous steps.
- **Challenges:** RNNs try to memorize the entire sequence, which becomes difficult for long sentences or sequences because information from the distant past can get lost or diluted.



### 3. üèóÔ∏è Encoder-Decoder Architecture

Many sequence-to-sequence models, including early RNN-based models, use an **encoder-decoder** structure:

- The **encoder** processes the input sequence and compresses it into a fixed-size context vector (a summary of the input).
- The **decoder** uses this context vector to generate the output sequence.
- However, this approach struggles with long sequences because the fixed context vector can‚Äôt capture all the necessary details.



### 4. üéØ Attention Mechanism: Focusing on Important Parts

The **attention mechanism** was introduced to solve the problem of long sequences by allowing the model to focus on specific parts of the input when generating each output word.

- Imagine translating the sentence: *"The man in the red jacket takes a dog for a walk."* Instead of trying to remember the whole sentence, the model learns to focus on relevant words (like "dog" when translating "chien").
- Attention assigns **weights** (denoted as ùõº) to each input word, indicating how much the model should focus on that word when producing a particular output word.
- These weights are calculated using a small neural network and normalized with a SoftMax function to ensure they sum to 1.
- This mechanism allows the model to dynamically attend to different parts of the input for each output word, improving translation quality, especially for longer sentences.



### 5. ‚ö° Transformers: Architecture Overview

Transformers build on the attention mechanism and eliminate the need for sequential processing entirely:

- They rely **entirely on self-attention** to compute representations of input and output sequences.
- This means no recurrent or convolutional layers are used.
- Transformers are composed of **stacks of transformer blocks**, each containing:
  - **Self-attention layers**
  - **Feedforward neural networks (fully connected layers)**
  - **Residual connections** and **normalization layers** to stabilize training and improve performance.



### 6. üîç Self-Attention: Understanding Relationships in Data

Self-attention is the core of the transformer:

- It models relationships between **all words in a sentence simultaneously**, regardless of their position.
- This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies without passing information through intermediate steps, unlike RNNs.
- Self-attention enables **parallel computation**, making transformers faster and more scalable.

#### How Self-Attention Works:

1. For each word (input vector), compute a **score** with every other word in the sequence.
2. Apply a SoftMax function to these scores to get attention weights (how much focus to give each word).
3. Use these weights to compute a weighted sum of all input vectors, producing a new representation for each word that incorporates context from the entire sequence.



### 7. üß© Query, Key, and Value Vectors in Self-Attention

To implement self-attention, each input word is transformed into three vectors:

- **Query (Q):** Represents the current word‚Äôs focus when comparing to others.
- **Key (K):** Represents each word being compared against.
- **Value (V):** Contains the actual information used to compute the output.

These vectors are created by multiplying the input embeddings by learned weight matrices \( W_Q, W_K, W_V \).

The attention score between two words is computed as the dot product of the query vector of one word and the key vector of another. These scores are normalized and used to weight the value vectors, producing the output.



### 8. üèóÔ∏è Transformer Block Structure

Each transformer block consists of:

- **Self-Attention Layer:** Computes attention-based representations.
- **Feedforward Layer:** Applies a fully connected neural network to each position independently.
- **Residual Connections:** Add the input of a layer to its output to help gradients flow and avoid vanishing gradients.
- **Normalization Layers:** Normalize outputs to stabilize and speed up training.



### 9. üß† Multi-Head Attention: Capturing Multiple Relationships

A single self-attention layer might not capture all types of relationships between words. To address this, transformers use **multi-head attention**:

- Multiple self-attention layers (called heads) run in parallel, each with its own set of parameters.
- Each head learns to focus on different aspects of the input sequence.
- The outputs of all heads are concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final output.
- This allows the model to capture richer and more diverse relationships between words.



### 10. üìç Positional Embeddings: Adding Order Information

Since transformers process all words simultaneously, they need a way to understand the order of words in a sequence:

- **Positional embeddings** are vectors added to the input word embeddings to encode the position of each word.
- These embeddings can be learned during training or fixed (e.g., sinusoidal functions).
- By adding positional embeddings, the model knows the relative or absolute position of each token, which is crucial for understanding language.



### 11. üè¢ Transformer Encoder and Decoder

Transformers have two main components:

- **Encoder:** Processes the input sequence and generates contextualized representations.
  - Contains multi-head self-attention and feedforward layers.
- **Decoder:** Generates the output sequence, one token at a time.
  - Contains two multi-head attention layers: one for self-attention on the output generated so far, and one for attention over the encoder‚Äôs output.
  - Also includes feedforward layers and residual connections.

The decoder works **autoregressively**, meaning it generates each word based on previously generated words and the encoder‚Äôs output.



### 12. üåü Popular Transformer-Based Models

Several influential models are based on the transformer architecture, each designed for different tasks:

#### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

- An **encoder-only** model.
- Pre-trained on large text corpora using:
  - **Masked Language Model (MLM):** Randomly masks words and predicts them.
  - **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):** Predicts if one sentence follows another.
- Fine-tuned for specific tasks like question answering, sentiment analysis, etc.
- Variants include RoBERTa, ALBERT, XLNet.

#### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

- A **decoder-only** model.
- Uses **unidirectional, autoregressive** modeling: predicts the next word based on previous words.
- Pre-trained on massive datasets to predict the next word.
- Fine-tuned for tasks like text generation, chatbots, summarization.

#### T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

- Frames all NLP tasks as text-to-text problems (input and output are text).
- Pre-trained with a masked language modeling objective.
- Fine-tuned to perform a wide range of tasks such as translation, summarization, and classification.



## Summary

Transformers revolutionized how machines process sequential data by replacing recurrence with self-attention, enabling efficient parallel processing and better handling of long-range dependencies. Their architecture, based on multi-head self-attention, feedforward layers, and positional embeddings, forms the backbone of many state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT, GPT, and T5.
