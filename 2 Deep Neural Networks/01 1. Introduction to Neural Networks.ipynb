       "Neural networks are inspired by the biological networks of neurons found in animal brains, especially humans. The human brain contains about a trillion neurons, which are specialized cells that process and transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. Understanding these biological neurons helps us design artificial neural networks that can solve complex problems in machine learning.\n",

       "\n",

       "- **Neuron**: The fundamental unit of the nervous system, a neuron receives inputs from other neurons and produces an output signal if certain conditions are met.\n",
       "- **Signal Transmission**: Neurons receive electrical signals at their dendrites, which come from the axon terminals of other neurons. These signals cross a tiny gap called the synaptic cleft.\n",
       "- **Synaptic Strength (Weight)**: The amount of signal passed depends on the synapse's strength, modeled as a weight (w) in artificial neurons.\n",
       "- **Weighted Sum**: The neuron sums all incoming signals multiplied by their respective weights.\n",
       "- **Firing**: If this weighted sum exceeds a threshold, the neuron fires, sending an action potential (voltage spike) down its axon.\n",
       "- **Types of Synapses**:\n",
       "  - **Excitatory Synapses**: Increase the likelihood of firing (modeled with positive weights).\n",
