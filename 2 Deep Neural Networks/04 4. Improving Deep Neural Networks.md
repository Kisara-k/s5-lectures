## Study Notes: Improving Deep Neural Networks üöÄ



### 1. üß† Introduction to Improving Deep Neural Networks

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized many fields, but training them effectively and improving their performance remains a challenge. This study note covers several important techniques and architectural innovations that help make deep networks train faster, generalize better, and avoid common pitfalls like overfitting and vanishing gradients. We will explore normalization methods, dropout, early stopping, data augmentation, and advanced architectures like Residual Networks (ResNets) and DenseNets.



### 2. ‚öñÔ∏è Normalization: Making Inputs and Layers Consistent

#### Why Normalize Inputs?

When training neural networks, the scale and distribution of input features can greatly affect learning. If features have very different ranges or distributions, the network may struggle to converge or learn efficiently. Normalizing inputs means adjusting them so they have a mean (average) of zero and a standard deviation (spread) of one. This standardization helps the network learn more quickly and reliably.

**Important:** The same mean (Œº) and standard deviation (œÉ) used to normalize the training data must also be applied to the test data. This ensures consistency and prevents the model from seeing data in a different scale during testing.

#### Normalization for Intermediate Layers: Batch Normalization

Normalization isn‚Äôt just for inputs. It can also be applied inside the network, between layers, to stabilize and speed up training. This is called **Batch Normalization**.

- **What it does:** Batch normalization normalizes the weighted sums (often called pre-activations or Y‚Äôs) of a layer before passing them through the activation function.
- **How it works:** For each mini-batch during training, it computes the mean and standard deviation of the layer‚Äôs outputs and normalizes them to have zero mean and unit variance.
- **Scaling and shifting:** Simply normalizing to zero mean and unit variance might limit the network‚Äôs ability to represent complex functions. So, batch normalization includes learnable parameters that scale and shift the normalized values, allowing the network to restore any necessary distribution.
- **Placement:** It is common to apply batch normalization **before** the activation function, although some debate exists about whether it should be before or after.

Batch normalization helps reduce the problem of internal covariate shift, where the distribution of inputs to each layer changes during training, making learning more stable and faster.



### 3. ‚ùå Dropout: Preventing Overfitting by Randomly Dropping Neurons

Overfitting happens when a network learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data. Dropout is a simple yet powerful technique to reduce overfitting.

- **How dropout works:** During training, dropout randomly "drops" (sets to zero) a fraction of neurons in the network along with their connections. Each neuron is kept with a probability \( p \) (e.g., 0.8 means 80% chance to keep a neuron).
- **Effect:** This forces the network to not rely too heavily on any single neuron and encourages redundancy and robustness.
- **During testing:** Dropout is turned off, but the outgoing weights of neurons are scaled by the probability \( p \) to balance the expected output.

Dropout was introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) and remains a widely used regularization method.



### 4. ‚èπÔ∏è Early Stopping: Avoiding Overtraining

Training a neural network for too long can lead to overfitting. Early stopping is a simple way to prevent this:

- **How it works:** During training, monitor the error (loss) on a separate validation set.
- **Stop training:** As soon as the validation error starts to increase (even if training error keeps decreasing), stop training.
- This means stopping **before** the training error reaches its minimum, which helps keep the model generalizable.



### 5. üîÑ Data Augmentation: Creating More Training Data

More data usually means better models, but collecting new data can be expensive or impractical. Data augmentation artificially increases the size of the training set by applying transformations to existing data.

- **Examples:** Rotations, flips, scaling, cropping, color changes, noise addition.
- **Benefits:** Augmented data helps the model generalize better by exposing it to more varied examples.
- **Limitations:** Augmented data is not as good as real new data but is a cost-effective alternative.



### 6. üèóÔ∏è Problems with Typical Deep CNNs

Before diving into advanced architectures, it‚Äôs important to understand the challenges faced by traditional deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs):

- **Exploding/Vanishing Gradients:** Gradients used for learning can become too large or too small as they propagate back through many layers, making training unstable or slow.
- **Degradation Problem:** As networks get deeper, accuracy can saturate and then degrade, even on training data. This is not due to overfitting but because deeper layers sometimes fail to learn useful transformations.

#### Solutions to these problems include:

- Normalized weight initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010)
- Batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015)
- New architectures like ResNets and DenseNets



### 7. üîó Residual Networks (ResNets): Learning Residuals Instead of Direct Mappings

ResNets were introduced by He et al. (2016) to solve the degradation problem by making it easier for layers to learn identity mappings.

#### The core idea:

- Instead of learning a direct mapping \( H(X) \) from input \( X \) to output, the network learns a **residual function** \( F(X) = H(X) - X \).
- The output of the block is then \( Y = F(X) + X \).
- If the optimal function is close to identity, learning the residual \( F(X) \) (which might be zero or small) is easier than learning \( H(X) \) from scratch.

#### Why this helps:

- The identity shortcut connections allow gradients to flow directly through the network, reducing vanishing gradient problems.
- If the residual is zero, the block simply passes the input forward unchanged, preventing degradation.
- This design enables very deep networks (e.g., 50, 101, 152 layers) to be trained effectively.

#### Architecture details:

- Residual blocks typically have 2 or 3 layers.
- If the input and output dimensions differ, a linear projection \( W_s \) is applied to \( X \) to match dimensions before addition.

#### Experimental results:

- ResNets outperform traditional deep networks on benchmarks like ImageNet.
- They achieve lower training and validation errors without increasing the number of parameters.



### 8. üåê Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets): Connecting All Layers

DenseNets, introduced by Huang et al. (2017), take connectivity a step further by connecting **every layer to every other layer** in a feed-forward fashion.

#### How DenseNets work:

- Each layer receives as input the concatenation of the outputs of all preceding layers.
- Formally, the output of layer \( l \) is:
  \[
  X_l = H_l([X_0, X_1, ..., X_{l-1}])
  \]
  where \( H_l \) is a composite function (batch norm, ReLU, convolution), and \([ \cdot ]\) denotes concatenation, not addition.

#### Advantages of DenseNets:

- **Fewer parameters:** Because each layer only needs to produce a small number of new feature maps (channels), the total number of parameters is reduced.
- **Improved gradient flow:** Direct connections allow gradients to flow easily backward, alleviating vanishing gradients.
- **Feature reuse:** Layers can reuse features from all previous layers, improving efficiency.

#### Why fewer parameters?

- Traditional networks must pass all information through each layer, requiring many feature maps.
- DenseNets separate preserved information (from previous layers) and new information (computed by the current layer).
- This reduces the need for large numbers of feature maps per layer.

#### Architecture details:

- DenseNets are organized into **dense blocks**, where layers are densely connected.
- Between dense blocks, **transition layers** reduce the size of feature maps using batch normalization, 1x1 convolutions, and 2x2 average pooling.
- This allows the network to reduce spatial dimensions while maintaining dense connectivity within blocks.

#### Experimental results:

- DenseNets achieve competitive or better accuracy than ResNets on ImageNet with fewer parameters and less computation (FLOPs).



### 9. üìö Summary and References
