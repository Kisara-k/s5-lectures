## Study Notes on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)  
*Based on Dr. Sandareka Wickramanayake‚Äôs Lecture*



### 1. üß† Biological Neurons: The Foundation of SNNs

To understand Spiking Neural Networks, it‚Äôs essential to first grasp how biological neurons work, as SNNs are inspired by the brain‚Äôs natural processing units.

- **What is a neuron?**  
  A neuron is the basic building block of the brain and nervous system. It processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals.

- **Key parts of a neuron:**  
  - **Dendrites:** These are the input branches of a neuron. They receive signals (called spikes) from other neurons.  
  - **Axon:** This is the output branch that sends signals to other neurons.  
  - **Synapse:** The connection point where the axon of one neuron meets the dendrite of another. This is where communication happens.

- **How neurons communicate:**  
  When a neuron receives input spikes, its internal electrical potential changes. If this potential reaches a certain threshold, the neuron "fires" ‚Äî it produces an output spike. After firing, the neuron‚Äôs potential drops below its resting level and enters a refractory period, during which it is less sensitive to new inputs.

- **Scale and complexity:**  
  A single neuron can connect to over 10,000 other neurons. The human brain contains roughly 100 billion neurons and about 500 trillion synapses, enabling incredibly complex processing.

- **Important biological behavior:**  
  - The neuron‚Äôs potential increases or decreases based on incoming spikes.  
  - After firing, the neuron‚Äôs potential falls below resting potential (hyperpolarization).  
  - The refractory period prevents immediate re-firing, ensuring controlled signal transmission.



### 2. ‚ö° What Are Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)?

Spiking Neural Networks are a type of artificial neural network designed to mimic the behavior of biological neurons more closely than traditional artificial neurons.

- **Difference from traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):**  
  - ANNs process information as continuous values that change smoothly over time.  
  - SNNs process information as discrete events called **spikes** that occur at specific points in time.

- **Spike trains:**  
  Inputs and outputs in SNNs are sequences of spikes over time, known as spike trains. Instead of passing continuous signals, neurons communicate by sending spikes at particular moments.

- **Why SNNs?**  
  Because they mimic the brain‚Äôs natural way of processing information, SNNs have the potential to be more efficient and biologically plausible.



### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è How Does an SNN Work?

Understanding the operation of an SNN requires looking at how neurons in the network change their internal state and communicate.

- **Neuron state:**  
  At any moment, each neuron has a value representing its membrane potential (similar to the electrical potential in biological neurons).

- **Input spikes:**  
  When a neuron receives a spike from an upstream neuron, its potential changes ‚Äî it can increase or decrease depending on the connection strength (synaptic weight).

- **Threshold and firing:**  
  If the neuron‚Äôs potential exceeds a certain threshold, it fires a spike to all downstream neurons it connects to.

- **Reset and recovery:**  
  After firing, the neuron‚Äôs potential immediately drops below its average resting level and then gradually returns to that resting potential over time.

This process allows neurons to communicate using discrete spikes, encoding information in the timing and pattern of these spikes.



### 4. üßÆ Modeling Neurons in SNNs: The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Model

To simulate neurons in SNNs, mathematical models are used. The most popular and widely used model is the **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** model.

- **How LIF works:**  
  - The neuron integrates incoming spikes by increasing or decreasing its potential based on the synaptic weights.  
  - The potential "leaks" over time, meaning it gradually decreases if no new spikes arrive (this models the natural decay of electrical potential in biological neurons).  
  - When the potential reaches a threshold, the neuron fires a spike and resets its potential.

- **Why LIF?**  
  It‚Äôs simple yet captures the essential dynamics of biological neurons: integration of inputs, threshold firing, and leakage.

- **Note on increments:**  
  The changes in potential due to spikes are step functions ‚Äî they happen suddenly when a spike arrives, unlike smooth curves seen in some other models.



### 5. üèóÔ∏è SNN Architectures: How Neurons Are Connected

SNNs can be organized in different ways depending on how neurons are connected and how information flows.

- **Feedforward Networks:**  
  Information flows strictly in one direction ‚Äî from input neurons, through hidden layers, to output neurons. There are no loops or cycles.

- **Recurrent Networks:**  
  Neurons can connect back to themselves or to previous layers, forming loops. This allows the network to maintain a form of memory and process sequences over time.

- **Hybrid Networks:**  
  Combine both feedforward and recurrent connections, leveraging the advantages of both architectures.



### 6. üéØ How to Train an SNN?

Training SNNs is a challenging and active area of research because traditional training methods like gradient descent don‚Äôt work well due to the discrete nature of spikes.

- **Why training is hard:**  
  The spiking function is not differentiable, so backpropagation (the standard method for training ANNs) cannot be directly applied.

- **Training methods:**  
  - **Unsupervised learning:**  
    - **Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP):**  
      This is a biologically inspired learning rule where synaptic weights change based on the relative timing of spikes between neurons.  
      - If a presynaptic neuron fires just before a postsynaptic neuron, the connection is strengthened (potentiation).  
      - If it fires after, the connection is weakened (depression).  
    - **Growing Spiking Neural Networks:** Networks that evolve their structure during training.  
  - **Supervised learning:**  
    - **SpikeProp:** An adaptation of backpropagation for SNNs.  
    - **Remote Supervised Method (ReSuMe):** Another supervised approach to adjust weights based on desired spike timings.



### 7. ü§ñ Deep Learning with SNNs

- It is theoretically possible to build deep spiking neural networks that have multiple layers and complex architectures similar to deep ANNs.

- However, **current spiking deep neural networks do not yet match the performance of traditional deep neural networks** in many tasks.

- Research is ongoing to improve training methods and architectures to close this performance gap.



### 8. ‚úÖ Advantages and ‚ùå Disadvantages of SNNs

#### Advantages of SNNs:

- **Dynamic processing:**  
  SNNs naturally handle time-dependent data, making them well-suited for tasks like speech recognition and dynamic image processing.

- **Online learning:**  
  SNNs can continue to learn and adapt while operating, similar to how biological brains learn continuously.

- **Efficiency:**  
  Because neurons communicate via discrete spikes rather than continuous values, SNNs can be faster and more energy-efficient.

- **Fewer neurons needed:**  
  SNNs often require fewer neurons than traditional ANNs to perform similar tasks.

- **Noise immunity:**  
  The temporal coding of information in spikes makes SNNs more robust to noise.

#### Disadvantages of SNNs:

- **Training difficulty:**  
  The lack of differentiability and the discrete nature of spikes make training SNNs much harder than traditional ANNs.

- **Performance gap:**  
  Currently, SNNs do not perform as well as traditional ANNs on many standard machine learning benchmarks.



## Summary

They offer advantages in dynamic processing, efficiency, and biological plausibility but face significant challenges in training and performance. Understanding biological neurons, neuron models like LIF, and learning rules such as STDP is key to grasping how SNNs function and how they might evolve in the future.
