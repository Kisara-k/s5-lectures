       "### 1. üëÅÔ∏è What is Computer Vision?\n",
       "\n",
       "Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, much like human vision. The goal is to enable machines to \"see\" and make sense of images or videos, extracting meaningful information such as identifying objects, understanding scenes, or even predicting actions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Humans are naturally very good at recognizing objects, understanding scenes, and interpreting subtle visual cues like shading and texture. However, computers face many challenges in matching this ability because images can vary widely due to lighting, viewpoint, scale, and occlusion (objects blocking each other).\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite these challenges, recent advances in **deep learning** have dramatically improved computer vision capabilities, especially in the last five years. Deep neural networks have accelerated progress, enabling computers to perform tasks like object detection, segmentation, and recognition with increasing accuracy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. üñºÔ∏è Core Tasks in Computer Vision\n",
       "\n",
       "Computer vision involves several fundamental tasks, each with its own challenges and methods:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Image Classification:** Assigning a label to an entire image (e.g., \"cat,\" \"dog,\" \"car\").\n",
       "- **Object Detection:** Identifying and locating multiple objects within an image by drawing bounding boxes around them.\n",
       "- **Semantic Segmentation:** Labeling each pixel in an image with a category (e.g., all pixels belonging to \"grass\" or \"cat\"), but without distinguishing between different instances of the same object.\n",
       "- **Instance Segmentation:** Like semantic segmentation, but also differentiates between individual instances of objects (e.g., two separate cats).\n",
       "- **Localization:** Finding the position of a single object within an image.\n",
       "- **3D Shape Prediction:** Understanding the three-dimensional structure of objects from 2D images.\n",
       "\n",
       "Each of these tasks requires different approaches and architectures, often building on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. üîç Why is Computer Vision Difficult?\n",
       "\n",
       "Computer vision is challenging due to several factors:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Viewpoint Variation:** Objects look different from different angles.\n",
       "- **Illumination Changes:** Lighting can drastically alter the appearance of objects.\n",
       "- **Scale Variation:** Objects can appear at different sizes depending on distance.\n",
       "- **Intra-class Variation:** Objects of the same class (e.g., dogs) can look very different.\n",
       "- **Background Clutter:** Objects may be partially hidden or surrounded by distracting backgrounds.\n",
       "- **Occlusion:** Objects may be partially blocked by other objects.\n",
       "- **Motion Blur:** Moving objects or camera shake can blur images.\n",
       "\n",
       "These factors make it hard for algorithms to consistently recognize and segment objects.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. üß† Deep Learning Architectures for Computer Vision\n",
       "\n",
       "Deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has revolutionized computer vision. CNNs use layers of filters (kernels) that scan across images to detect patterns like edges, textures, and shapes. These features are combined in deeper layers to recognize complex objects.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key architectures for object detection and segmentation include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **R-CNN (Region-based CNN):** Extracts region proposals (candidate object locations) and classifies each region separately.\n",
       "- **Fast R-CNN:** Improves speed by running the CNN once on the whole image and then cropping features for each region.\n",
       "- **Faster R-CNN:** Adds a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate proposals directly from CNN features, speeding up the process.\n",
       "- **Mask R-CNN:** Extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch to predict pixel-level masks for instance segmentation.\n",
       "- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** A single-stage detector that divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously, enabling real-time detection.\n",
       "- **SSD (Single Shot Detector):** Similar to YOLO, it predicts bounding boxes and classes in one pass but uses multiple feature maps at different scales.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. ü™ü Traditional Object Detection Methods\n",
       "\n",
       "Before deep learning, object detection relied on:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Sliding Window Technique:** The image is scanned with a fixed-size window at multiple scales and locations. Each window is classified as object or background. This is computationally expensive because it requires evaluating thousands of windows.\n",
       "- **Region Proposal Methods (Selective Search):** Instead of scanning every window, these methods generate a smaller set of candidate regions likely to contain objects by grouping similar pixels (\"blobs\"). These proposals are then classified.\n",
       "\n",
       "These methods were slow and less accurate compared to modern deep learning approaches.\n",

       "\n",
       "##### Faster R-CNN\n",
       "\n",
       "- Introduces a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares CNN features.\n",
       "- RPN predicts object proposals directly, eliminating selective search.\n",
       "- Two-stage detector: first propose regions, then classify and refine.\n",
       "- Balances speed and accuracy well but is not real-time.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",

       "##### 6. Select all that apply: Which methods are part of the R-CNN family?  \n",
       "**Correct answers:** A) R-CNN, B) Fast R-CNN, C) Faster R-CNN  \n",
       "**Explanation:** YOLO is a different, single-stage detector, not part of the R-CNN family.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 7. How does Fast R-CNN improve over the original R-CNN?  \n",
       "**Correct answers:** A) It runs the CNN once on the entire image instead of on each region proposal, C) It uses selective search for region proposals  \n",
       "**Explanation:** Fast R-CNN shares computation by running CNN once and crops features for proposals. It still uses selective search but no longer runs CNN per region. It does not remove region proposals (B) or use SVMs (D).\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 8. What is the role of the Region Proposal Network (RPN) in Faster R-CNN?  \n",
       "**Correct answer:** A) To generate candidate object regions directly from CNN features  \n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "##### 11. In semantic segmentation, why is it inefficient to classify each pixel using a sliding window approach?  \n",
       "**Correct answer:** A) Because it requires classifying many overlapping patches independently  \n",
       "**Explanation:** Overlapping patches cause redundant computation, making sliding window inefficient.\n",
