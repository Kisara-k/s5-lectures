## 6. Cost Volume Profit Analysis

## Key Points

#### 1. üßæ Absorption Costing  
- Absorption costing allocates **all manufacturing costs** (direct materials, direct labor, variable and fixed overhead) to products.  
- Overhead absorption involves three stages: **Allocation**, **Apportionment**, and **Absorption**.  
- **Overhead Absorption Rate (OAR)** can be **actual** or **predetermined**; predetermined OAR uses budgeted overhead and activity levels for planning and control.  
- Common bases for overhead absorption include: **production units**, **percentage of direct labor/material/prime cost**, **direct labor hours**, and **machine hours**.  
- **Blanket overhead absorption** applies a single overhead rate across the entire plant or department.  
- Over/under absorbed overhead occurs when actual overhead or activity levels differ from budgeted figures.


#### 2. üîÑ Activity-Based Costing (ABC)  
- ABC assigns overhead costs to products based on **activities** that consume resources, using **activity cost pools** and **cost drivers**.  
- Cost drivers are factors causing changes in activity costs (e.g., number of production runs, inspections).  
- ABC involves four steps: identify activities and cost pools, identify cost drivers, compute overhead rates per pool, assign overhead costs to products using these rates.  
- ABC uses **more cost centers and cost drivers** than absorption costing, leading to more accurate product costing.  
- Benefits include identifying root causes of costs, accurate product profitability, and better cost control.  
- **Activity-Based Management (ABM)** extends ABC to focus on reducing costs and improving processes by analyzing value-added and non-value-added activities.


#### 3. üí∞ Marginal Costing  
- Marginal costing charges **only variable costs** (direct materials, labor, variable overhead) to products; fixed costs are treated as period expenses.  
- Fixed manufacturing overheads are **not absorbed** by products under marginal costing.  
- Marginal cost is the **additional cost to produce one more unit**.  
- Marginal costing is useful for **management decision-making** but not for external financial reporting.  
- Absorption costing includes fixed overhead in product cost; marginal costing does not.


#### 4. üìä Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) and Breakeven Analysis  
- Breakeven point (BEP) is where **total revenue equals total costs**, resulting in zero profit or loss.  
- BEP formula (units): \(\text{BEP} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Cost per Unit}}\)  
- Contribution margin = Selling price per unit - Variable cost per unit.  
- Contribution/Sales (C/S) ratio = \(\frac{\text{Contribution}}{\text{Sales}} \times 100\%\).  
- Margin of Safety (MOS) = Budgeted sales - Breakeven sales; indicates sales buffer before losses occur.  
- Breakeven analysis helps in financial planning, risk assessment, strategy development, and investment decisions.


#### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Breakeven Analysis  
- Applicable only to a **single product or fixed product mix**.  
- Assumes **fixed costs remain constant** at all output levels.  
- Assumes **variable cost per unit and sales price per unit are constant**.  
- Assumes **production equals sales** (ignores inventory changes).  
- Ignores uncertainty in cost and sales estimates.  
- Preparing breakeven charts can be **time-consuming**.


#### 6. üßÆ Key Formulas  
- Predetermined Overhead Absorption Rate (OAR) = \(\frac{\text{Budgeted Overhead}}{\text{Budgeted Activity}}\)  
- Marginal Cost = Additional cost to produce one more unit.  
- Contribution per unit = Selling price - Variable cost per unit.  
- Breakeven Point (units) = \(\frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Contribution per unit}}\)  
- Breakeven Point (sales value) = \(\frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Contribution/Sales ratio}}\)  
- Contribution/Sales Ratio = \(\frac{\text{Contribution}}{\text{Sales}} \times 100\%\)  
- Margin of Safety = Budgeted Sales - Breakeven Sales.

## Study Notes

### 1. üßÆ Absorption Costing: Understanding Overhead Allocation and Absorption

Absorption costing is a traditional costing method used to allocate all manufacturing overhead costs to products. This means that every product absorbs a fair share of the overhead costs, including both variable and fixed manufacturing overheads. The goal is to determine the **full production cost** of each product, which is essential for pricing, inventory valuation, and financial reporting.

#### Key Concepts in Absorption Costing

- **Overhead Costs (OH):** These are indirect costs related to production but not directly traceable to a single product, such as factory rent, utilities, and supervisor salaries.
  
- **Stages of Absorption Costing:**
  1. **Allocation:** Charging identifiable overhead costs directly to a specific cost center or product.
  2. **Apportionment:** Dividing overhead costs that relate to multiple cost centers among those centers fairly.
  3. **Absorption:** Distributing the overhead costs allocated and apportioned to production departments across the units produced.

- **Overhead Absorption Rate (OAR):** This is the rate at which overheads are charged to each unit of production. It can be calculated using either actual overheads or predetermined (budgeted) overheads.

#### Why Use Predetermined Overhead Absorption Rates?

- Actual overhead costs and activity levels are only known at the end of the period, which delays costing.
- Predetermined rates use budgeted overheads and activity levels, allowing for timely costing, planning, and control.
- Formula for Predetermined OAR:

  \[
  \text{Predetermined OAR} = \frac{\text{Budgeted Production Overhead}}{\text{Budgeted Level of Activity}}
  \]

#### Methods of Overhead Absorption

Overhead can be absorbed using different bases depending on the nature of production:

1. **Production Unit Method:** Overhead per unit = Total overhead / Number of units produced.
2. **Percentage Methods:** Overhead absorbed as a percentage of:
   - Direct labor cost
   - Direct material cost
   - Prime cost (direct labor + direct materials)
3. **Hourly Rate Methods:**
   - Direct labor hour rate = Total overhead / Total labor hours
   - Machine hour rate = Total overhead / Total machine hours

#### Blanket Overhead Absorption

- A **single absorption rate** is applied across the entire plant or department.
- Simpler but less accurate when products consume overheads differently.

#### Over/Under Absorbed Overhead

- Occurs when actual overhead costs or activity levels differ from budgeted figures.
- Causes differences between overhead absorbed and actual overhead incurred.


### 2. üîç Activity-Based Costing (ABC): A More Accurate Overhead Allocation

Activity-Based Costing (ABC) is a modern costing method that assigns overhead costs to products based on the activities that generate those costs. Unlike absorption costing, which spreads overhead broadly, ABC recognizes that different products consume overhead activities differently.

#### Core Concepts of ABC

- **Activities:** These are tasks or events that consume resources (e.g., machine setups, inspections).
- **Activity Cost Pools:** Groupings of overhead costs related to a specific activity.
- **Cost Drivers:** Factors that cause changes in the cost of an activity (e.g., number of production runs, inspections).

#### Examples of Cost Drivers

| Activity               | Cost Driver                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Set-up costs          | Number of production runs     |
| Scheduling costs      | Number of production runs     |
| Material handling     | Number of production runs     |
| Inspection costs      | Number of inspections         |
| Inventory handling    | Number of purchase orders     |
| Dispatch costs        | Number of customer orders     |

#### Steps in ABC Costing

1. **Identify and classify major activities** and allocate overhead costs to these activity cost pools.
2. **Identify cost drivers** that strongly correlate with the costs in each pool.
3. **Calculate overhead rates** for each activity pool (Overhead cost / Cost driver units).
4. **Assign overhead costs** to products based on their consumption of activities using the overhead rates.

#### ABC vs. Absorption Costing

| Feature                 | Absorption Costing                  | Activity-Based Costing (ABC)          |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Number of cost centers   | Few (broad departments)            | Many (specific activities)           |
| Number of cost drivers   | Few (e.g., labor hours)            | Many (activity-specific drivers)     |
| Overhead allocation     | Based on broad averages             | Based on actual activity consumption |
| Accuracy                | Less accurate for diverse products | More accurate for complex products   |

#### Benefits of ABC

- Identifies root causes of costs and poor financial performance.
- Helps find most and least profitable products or channels.
- Provides accurate cost prediction.
- Tracks costs of activities, enabling better cost control.
- Supports better marketing and pricing decisions.
- Enhances negotiation power with customers.

#### Activity-Based Management (ABM)

- ABM extends ABC from costing to management.
- Focuses on reducing costs and improving processes by analyzing **value-added** and **non-value-added** activities.


### 3. üí° Marginal Costing: Focus on Variable Costs for Decision Making

Marginal costing is a costing technique where **only variable costs** (direct materials, direct labor, variable overheads) are charged to products. Fixed costs are treated as period costs and are expensed in the period incurred, not assigned to products.

#### Key Points About Marginal Costing

- Fixed manufacturing overheads are **not absorbed** by products.
- Useful for internal decision-making, such as pricing, budgeting, and cost control.
- Marginal cost = Cost of producing one additional unit.
- Helps in understanding the impact of production volume changes on costs and profits.

#### Marginal Cost Calculation Example

If producing 100 units costs Rs. 50,000 and producing 101 units costs Rs. 50,500, then:

\[
\text{Marginal Cost of 101st unit} = 50,500 - 50,000 = Rs. 500
\]

#### Difference Between Absorption and Marginal Costing

| Aspect                  | Absorption Costing                         | Marginal Costing                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Cost included in product | Direct materials, labor, variable & fixed overhead | Only direct materials, labor, variable overhead |
| Fixed overhead treatment | Absorbed into product cost                 | Treated as period cost (expensed immediately) |
| Use                     | External reporting, inventory valuation    | Internal decision-making, cost control  |


### 4. üìä Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis and Breakeven Analysis

CVP analysis studies how changes in costs and volume affect a company's profit. It helps businesses understand the relationship between sales volume, costs, and profits.

#### What is Breakeven Point (BEP)?

- The **breakeven point** is the level of sales where total revenue equals total costs, resulting in zero profit or loss.
- At BEP, **fixed costs = contribution** (contribution is sales revenue minus variable costs).

#### Why is Breakeven Analysis Important?

- Helps in financial planning by identifying minimum sales needed to avoid losses.
- Assists in risk assessment and strategic decision-making.
- Useful for pricing, cost control, and investment decisions.
- Demonstrates business viability to investors and lenders.

#### Key Terms in CVP Analysis

- **Fixed Costs:** Costs that do not change with production volume (e.g., rent, salaries).
- **Variable Costs:** Costs that vary directly with production volume (e.g., raw materials).
- **Contribution Margin:** The amount remaining from sales revenue after variable costs are deducted. It contributes to covering fixed costs and profit.
  
  \[
  \text{Contribution per unit} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Variable cost per unit}
  \]

- **Margin of Safety:** The difference between actual or projected sales and breakeven sales. It shows how much sales can drop before the business incurs losses.

#### Breakeven Point Formulas

- **In units:**

  \[
  \text{BEP (units)} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Contribution per unit}}
  \]

- **In sales value:**

  \[
  \text{BEP (sales value)} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Contribution/Sales ratio}}
  \]

- **Contribution/Sales (C/S) Ratio:**

  \[
  \text{C/S Ratio} = \frac{\text{Contribution}}{\text{Sales}} \times 100\%
  \]

- **Margin of Safety:**

  \[
  \text{MOS} = \text{Budgeted Sales} - \text{Breakeven Sales}
  \]

#### Example Calculation

A business sells a product at Rs. 50 per unit, variable cost Rs. 25 per unit, fixed costs Rs. 10,000.

- Contribution per unit = 50 - 25 = Rs. 25
- BEP (units) = 10,000 / 25 = 400 units
- Total revenue at BEP = 400 √ó 50 = Rs. 20,000
- Total cost at BEP = Fixed costs + Variable costs = 10,000 + (25 √ó 400) = Rs. 20,000

At 400 units, the business neither makes a profit nor a loss.


### 5. üìâ Limitations of Breakeven Analysis

While breakeven analysis is a powerful tool, it has some limitations:

- Assumes only one product or a fixed product mix.
- Assumes fixed costs remain constant regardless of output.
- Assumes variable cost per unit and sales price per unit are constant.
- Assumes production equals sales (ignores inventory changes).
- Ignores uncertainties in cost and sales estimates.
- Preparing breakeven charts can be time-consuming.
