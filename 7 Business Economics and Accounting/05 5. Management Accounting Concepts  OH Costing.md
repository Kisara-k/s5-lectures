## 5. Management Accounting Concepts  OH Costing

## Key Points

#### 1. üìä Management Accounting vs Financial Accounting  
- Management accounting provides information for internal managers to aid decision-making and control.  
- Financial accounting prepares reports for external users like shareholders and government.  
- Financial accounting focuses on past data; management accounting covers past, present, and future.  
- Financial accounting outputs include annual financial statements; management accounting provides detailed monthly/annual reports and ad hoc reports.  
- Financial accounting is regulated by accounting standards and laws; management accounting has no prescribed framework.

#### 2. üí∞ Definition of Cost and Cost Accounting  
- Cost is the value of resources sacrificed to achieve an objective, measured in monetary terms.  
- Cost accounting is a systematic procedure for recording and reporting manufacturing and service costs in detail.  
- Cost accounting helps in cost control, profit planning, budgeting, and decision-making.

#### 3. üè∑Ô∏è Key Cost Terms  
- Cost Unit: Unit of product, service, or time for which costs are measured (e.g., one bread, one minute of call).  
- Cost Centre: Location, person, or equipment where costs are collected and controlled.  
- Relevant Cost: Costs that affect management decisions.  
- Irrelevant Cost: Costs that do not affect decisions.  
- Opportunity Cost: The benefit foregone by choosing one alternative over another.  
- Standard Cost: Predetermined or estimated cost used as a target or benchmark.  
- Sunk Cost: Costs already incurred and unrecoverable, irrelevant for future decisions.

#### 4. üßæ Classification of Costs  
- Function-wise: Direct costs (traceable to product) vs Indirect costs (overheads, not directly traceable).  
- Elements-wise: Material cost, labor cost, and other costs (e.g., royalties).  
- Behavior-wise: Variable costs (change with activity), fixed costs (constant in total), semi-variable costs (both fixed and variable components).

#### 5. üè≠ Production and Overhead Costs  
- Prime Cost = Direct material + Direct labor + Direct other costs.  
- Production Overhead = Indirect manufacturing costs (e.g., indirect labor, indirect materials, factory rent).  
- Total Production Cost = Prime Cost + Production Overhead.

#### 6. üè∑Ô∏è Overhead Costing and Distribution  
- Overhead costs are indirect costs that must be allocated or apportioned to products.  
- Allocation: Directly assigning overhead to a cost centre.  
- Apportionment: Dividing overhead among cost centres based on a fair basis (e.g., floor area, machine hours).  
- Absorption: Charging overhead to products using predetermined rates.

#### 7. üè¢ Cost Centres  
- Cost centres are responsibility centres where costs are collected and controlled.  
- Types: Production cost centres, service cost centres, process cost centres.

#### 8. üîÑ Cost Allocation, Apportionment, and Re-apportionment  
- Cost allocation assigns whole costs directly to a cost centre.  
- Cost apportionment divides costs among multiple cost centres on an equitable basis.  
- Service department costs are re-apportioned to production departments.

#### 9. üîÑ Methods of Re-apportioning Service Department Costs  
- Direct Method: Allocates service costs directly to production departments, ignoring inter-service department services.  
- Step-Down Method: Allocates service costs sequentially, recognizing some inter-service support but not reciprocally.  
- Reciprocal Method (Simultaneous Equation): Recognizes mutual services between service departments using simultaneous equations; most accurate.

#### 10. üìä Material Cost Calculation Components  
- Material cost includes invoice price minus trade discount, plus freight charges, excise duty, non-refundable VAT, and container charges.  
- Container charges depend on the number of containers required per units ordered.

## Study Notes

### 1. üìö Introduction to Management Accounting

Management accounting is a branch of accounting focused on providing **useful financial and non-financial information to managers inside an organization**. This information helps managers make informed decisions, plan, control operations, and improve business performance.

Unlike **financial accounting**, which prepares reports mainly for external users such as shareholders, government, and creditors, management accounting is **internally focused**. It supports managers by giving detailed, timely, and relevant data about costs, revenues, and operations.

#### Key Differences Between Financial and Management Accounting

| Aspect                | Financial Accounting                          | Management Accounting                         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Stewardship and reporting to external parties | Decision-making and control within the company |
| **Time Horizon**      | Historical (past data)                        | Past, present, and future-oriented            |
| **Report Recipients** | External users (shareholders, government)   | Internal users (managers, directors)          |
| **Output**            | Annual financial statements (profit & loss, balance sheet, cash flow) | Detailed monthly/annual reports, product-wise results, ad hoc reports |
| **Regulation**        | Governed by accounting standards and laws   | No prescribed standards; flexible and tailored |


### 2. üí∞ Understanding Cost and Cost Accounting

#### What is Cost?

In management accounting, **cost** refers to the value of resources sacrificed to achieve a specific objective, such as producing a product or providing a service. It is usually measured in monetary terms and includes all expenses incurred to make or acquire something.

#### What is Cost Accounting?

Cost accounting is a **systematic process of recording, classifying, analyzing, and reporting costs** related to manufacturing goods or providing services. It helps management understand where money is spent and how efficiently resources are used.

#### Why is Cost Accounting Important?

- It explains production and non-production costs and how they appear in financial statements.
- It calculates the cost of products or services.
- It studies how costs behave when activity levels change.
- It analyzes cost-volume-profit relationships.
- It assists in profit planning and budgeting.
- It helps control costs by comparing actual costs with planned or standard costs.
- It provides relevant data for decision-making.


### 3. üè∑Ô∏è Key Cost Terminology

Understanding the following terms is essential for grasping management accounting concepts:

- **Cost Unit:** The unit of product, service, or time for which costs are measured.  
  *Example:* In telecommunications, a cost unit could be a minute of call time; in bread production, it‚Äôs one bread.

- **Cost Centre:** A location, person, or equipment where costs are collected and controlled.  
  *Example:* A factory department or a service unit like maintenance.

- **Relevant Cost:** Costs that are directly related to a specific management decision and will affect the outcome. Irrelevant costs are those that do not impact the decision.

- **Opportunity Cost:** The benefit foregone by choosing one alternative over another. It represents the cost of the next best alternative.

- **Standard Cost:** A predetermined or estimated cost that serves as a target or benchmark for measuring performance.

- **Sunk Cost:** Costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. These should not influence future decisions.


### 4. üßæ Classification of Costs

Costs can be classified in several ways to help managers analyze and control them effectively.

#### 4.1 Function-wise Classification

This classification is based on the **ease of tracing costs to a specific function or activity**.

- **Direct Costs:** Costs that can be directly and exclusively traced to a product or cost unit.  
  *Examples:* Direct materials (wood for furniture), direct labor (carpenter‚Äôs wages).

- **Indirect Costs:** Costs that cannot be directly traced to a product and are often shared across multiple products or departments. These are also called **overheads**.  
  *Examples:* Factory rent, maintenance wages, electricity for the factory.

#### 4.2 Elements-wise Classification

Costs are grouped by their nature or element:

- **Material Cost:** Cost of raw materials that become part of the finished product.  
  *Example:* Wood, paint, fabric.

- **Labor Cost:** Wages paid to workers directly involved in production.

- **Other Costs:** Costs other than materials and labor, such as royalties or license fees.

#### 4.3 Behavior-wise Classification

This classification is based on how costs behave with changes in activity levels:

- **Variable Costs:** Change in total directly with activity level but remain constant per unit.  
  *Example:* Raw materials cost increases as more units are produced.

- **Fixed Costs:** Remain constant in total regardless of activity level but decrease per unit as production increases.  
  *Example:* Factory rent.

- **Semi-variable (Step) Costs:** Contain both fixed and variable components.  
  *Example:* Electricity bill (fixed monthly charge + variable usage charge).


### 5. üè≠ Production and Overhead Costs

#### What is Production Cost?

Production cost is the total cost incurred to manufacture a product. It includes:

- **Prime Cost:** Sum of direct material, direct labor, and direct other costs.
- **Production Overhead:** Indirect manufacturing costs that cannot be traced directly to products.

#### Examples of Overhead Costs

- Indirect labor (maintenance staff, security guards)
- Indirect materials (lubricants, cleaning supplies)
- Factory rent and utilities

#### Total Production Cost Formula

```
Total Production Cost = Prime Cost + Production Overhead
```


### 6. üè∑Ô∏è Overhead Costing and Distribution

#### What is Overhead?

Overhead refers to all indirect costs related to production that cannot be directly assigned to a product. These costs must be **allocated or apportioned** to products to determine their full cost.

#### How are Overheads Distributed?

Overhead costs are distributed to products through three main steps:

1. **Allocation:** Directly assigning overhead costs to a specific cost center when possible.
2. **Apportionment:** Dividing overhead costs among multiple cost centers based on a fair basis (e.g., floor area, machine hours).
3. **Absorption:** Charging overhead costs to individual products based on a predetermined overhead rate.


### 7. üè¢ Cost Centres and Their Classification

A **cost centre** is a unit within an organization where costs are collected and controlled. Managers of cost centres are responsible for managing these costs.

#### Types of Cost Centres

- **Production Cost Centres:** Directly involved in manufacturing (e.g., machining, assembly).
- **Service Cost Centres:** Provide support services to production centres (e.g., maintenance, cafeteria).
- **Process Cost Centres:** Specific processes within production.


### 8. üîÑ Cost Allocation, Apportionment, and Re-apportionment

#### Cost Allocation vs. Cost Apportionment

- **Cost Allocation:** Assigning whole costs directly to a single cost centre or cost unit.
- **Cost Apportionment:** Dividing costs that benefit multiple cost centres on a fair basis.

#### Bases for Apportionment

Common bases include:

- Floor area (for rent, lighting)
- Machine hours (for machine maintenance)
- Number of employees (for welfare expenses)
- Quantity or value of materials (for storekeeping)

#### Service Department Cost Re-apportionment

Service department costs are often re-apportioned to production departments because service departments support production activities.


### 9. üîÑ Methods of Re-apportioning Service Department Costs

When service departments provide services to each other, their costs must be re-apportioned to production departments using one of the following methods:

#### 1. Direct Method

- Service department costs are allocated directly to production departments.
- Ignores services provided between service departments.
- Simple but may lead to inaccurate cost distribution.

#### 2. Step-Down Method

- Allocates service department costs sequentially.
- Recognizes some service department support to other service departments but not reciprocally.
- More accurate than the direct method.

#### 3. Reciprocal Method (Simultaneous Equation Method)

- Recognizes mutual services between service departments.
- Uses simultaneous equations to allocate costs accurately.
- Most precise but mathematically complex.


### 10. üìä Practical Example: Calculating Material Cost

Given a quotation for materials with different unit prices, trade discounts, cash discounts, freight, and container charges, the total material cost can be calculated by:

- Selecting the correct unit price based on quantity.
- Applying trade discounts.
- Adding freight charges.
- Adding container charges (based on number of containers needed).
- Applying cash discounts if payment terms are met.


### Summary

Management accounting is a vital tool for internal decision-making, focusing on detailed cost analysis and control. Understanding cost classifications, cost centres, overhead costing, and cost allocation methods equips managers to plan efficiently, control expenses, and price products accurately. Mastery of these concepts is essential for any business professional or accountant preparing for interviews or practical roles in finance and management.
