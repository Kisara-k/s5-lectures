## Study Notes

### 1. üì¶ Introduction to Inventory Management

Inventory refers to the stock of items or resources that an organization holds at any given time. These items can be raw materials waiting to be processed, work-in-progress goods currently being manufactured, or finished products ready for sale. Managing inventory effectively is crucial because it directly impacts production efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall business profitability.

An **inventory system** is a structured set of policies and controls that help an organization monitor and manage its inventory levels. This system answers key questions such as:  
- What items should be ordered?  
- How many units should be ordered?  
- When should the order be placed?  

The timing of orders is especially critical because ordering too early or too late can lead to excess stock or stockouts, both of which are costly.


### 2. üéØ Purpose of Holding Inventory

Organizations hold inventory for several important reasons, each aimed at ensuring smooth operations and cost efficiency:

- **Maintain independence of operations:** Inventory allows different departments or stages of production to operate independently without waiting for materials or products from other stages.
- **Meet variations in product demand:** Demand can fluctuate due to seasonality, market trends, or customer preferences. Inventory helps meet these unpredictable changes without delay.
- **Allow flexibility in production scheduling:** Having inventory on hand means production can continue smoothly even if there are changes in the schedule.
- **Safeguard against delivery delays:** Raw materials or components may not always arrive on time. Inventory acts as a buffer to prevent production stoppages.
- **Take advantage of economic purchase sizes and discounts:** Buying in bulk often reduces the cost per unit, so holding inventory can save money.
- **Benefit from currency fluctuations:** Sometimes, purchasing inventory in advance can protect against unfavorable changes in exchange rates.
- **Manage inventory costs:** Proper inventory management balances the costs of ordering, holding, and potential shortages.


### 3. üõ†Ô∏è Inventory Systems and Key Questions

An inventory system controls the processes of purchasing, storing, and issuing inventory. It must answer three fundamental questions:

- **What to order?** Deciding which items need replenishment.
- **How many to order?** Determining the optimal order quantity to minimize costs.
- **When to order?** Timing the order to avoid stockouts and excess inventory.

Among these, **timing is critical** because ordering too early increases holding costs, while ordering too late risks running out of stock.


### 4. üí∞ Types of Inventory Costs

Understanding the different costs associated with inventory is essential for effective management:

- **Ordering Costs (Co):** These are costs incurred every time an order is placed, such as administrative expenses, communication, and transportation.
- **Setup Costs:** In manufacturing, these are costs related to preparing equipment or production lines for a new batch.
- **Holding (or Carrying) Costs (Ch):** These include storage costs, insurance, depreciation, handling, and opportunity costs of capital tied up in inventory.
- **Shortage Costs:** Costs that arise when inventory runs out, including lost sales, emergency procurement costs, and potential damage to customer relationships.

Balancing these costs is key to optimizing inventory levels.


### 5. üìä Calculating Stock Levels

To manage inventory effectively, organizations calculate several important stock levels to avoid both excess inventory and stockouts:

- **Re-order Level (ROL):** The inventory level at which a new order should be placed. It ensures that new stock arrives before the current stock runs out.  
  Formula:  
  \[
  \text{Re-order Level} = \text{Maximum consumption during lead time} \times \text{Maximum lead time}
  \]  
  Or, more simply:  
  \[
  \text{Re-order Level} = \text{Average consumption per unit time} \times \text{Average lead time}
  \]

- **Maximum Stock Level (MSL):** The highest inventory level allowed to avoid tying up too much capital in stock.  
  Formula:  
  \[
  \text{Maximum Stock Level} = \text{Re-order Level} + \text{Re-order Quantity (EOQ)}
  \]

- **Minimum Stock Level:** Also called safety or buffer stock, this is the lowest inventory level that should be maintained to prevent stockouts.  
  Formula:  
  \[
  \text{Minimum Stock Level} = \text{Re-order Level} - (\text{Average consumption} \times \text{Average lead time})
  \]

- **Average Stock Level:** This is the average amount of inventory held over a period, often calculated as:  
  \[
  \text{Average Stock Level} = \frac{\text{Maximum Stock Level} + \text{Minimum Stock Level}}{2}
  \]

These levels help maintain a balance between having enough stock to meet demand and minimizing holding costs.


### 6. üìê Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

EOQ is a fundamental concept in inventory management that determines the most cost-effective quantity to order each time fresh supplies are needed. The goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes ordering costs and holding costs.

The EOQ formula is:  
\[
EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times D \times Co}{Ch}}
\]  
Where:  
- \(D\) = Annual demand (units)  
- \(Co\) = Cost of placing one order  
- \(Ch\) = Annual holding cost per unit

**Key assumptions for EOQ:**  
- Demand is known and constant throughout the year.  
- Lead time (time between ordering and receiving) is constant.  
- Costs of ordering and holding remain constant.  
- No stockouts occur.

EOQ helps organizations avoid ordering too frequently (which increases ordering costs) or ordering too much at once (which increases holding costs).


### 7. üìö Inventory Valuation Methods

Inventory valuation is important for financial reporting and cost control. Two common methods are:

- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** Assumes that the oldest inventory items are sold or used first. This method reflects current costs in ending inventory and older costs in cost of goods sold.  
- **WAC (Weighted Average Cost):** Calculates an average cost per unit based on total cost of goods available for sale divided by total units available. This smooths out price fluctuations.

#### Example Transactions for Inventory Ledger Preparation

Consider the following transactions in January 2020:  
- Opening balance: 200 units @ 500 each  
- Purchase: 300 units @ 600 each  
- Issue: 250 units  
- Purchase: 100 units @ 650 each  
- Issue: 175 units  

Using FIFO, the oldest stock is issued first, while WAC recalculates the average cost after each purchase.


### 8. üìù Practice Questions Overview

To solidify understanding, practice questions typically involve:

- Calculating **Re-order Level**, **Maximum Stock Level**, **Minimum Stock Level**, and **Average Stock Level** using given consumption rates and lead times.
- Computing **EOQ** based on monthly usage, ordering costs, and carrying costs.
- Preparing inventory ledgers using **FIFO** and **WAC** methods based on transaction data.


### Summary

Inventory management is a critical function that balances the need to have enough stock to meet demand while minimizing costs associated with ordering and holding inventory. Understanding the purpose of inventory, the types of costs involved, how to calculate key stock levels, and how to determine the optimal order quantity (EOQ) are foundational skills. Additionally, knowing how to value inventory using FIFO and WAC methods is essential for accurate financial reporting and cost control.
