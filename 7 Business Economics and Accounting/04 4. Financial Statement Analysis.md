## Study Notes

### 1. üìä Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis

Financial Statement Analysis is a **systematic process** of examining the financial information presented in a company‚Äôs financial statements, such as the Balance Sheet and the Statement of Profit and Loss. The goal is to understand the company‚Äôs financial health, operational efficiency, and overall performance to make informed decisions.

At its core, financial statement analysis involves **studying the relationships between various financial figures**. These figures can be from the same statement or across different statements. Because financial statements contain complex data, analysis breaks this data down into simpler, meaningful elements and explores how these elements relate to each other.

This process is essential for stakeholders like investors, creditors, management, and analysts to evaluate the company‚Äôs past performance, current position, and future prospects.


### 2. üîç Tools and Techniques of Financial Statement Analysis

There are three primary tools used to analyze financial statements:

#### 2.1 Comparative Statements (Horizontal Analysis)

This technique compares financial data across **two or more years** for the same company. The amounts for each year are placed side by side, and the changes are calculated both in absolute terms and percentages. This helps identify trends, growth patterns, or declines over time.

- **Purpose:** To track progress or deterioration in financial performance.
- **Example:** Comparing sales revenue in 2022 and 2023 to see if sales are increasing or decreasing.

#### 2.2 Common Size Statements (Vertical Analysis)

Vertical analysis expresses each item in a financial statement as a **percentage of a common base** within the same period.

- For the **Balance Sheet**, the base is usually total assets or total liabilities and equity (which are equal).
- For the **Income Statement**, the base is typically total revenue or net sales.

This method helps understand the **relative size and importance** of each item, making it easier to compare companies of different sizes or analyze the structure of a company‚Äôs finances.

#### 2.3 Ratio Analysis

Ratios are **arithmetical expressions** that show the relationship between two related financial figures. They provide insights into various aspects of a company‚Äôs financial health, such as liquidity, profitability, solvency, and efficiency.

- Ratios simplify complex financial data into understandable metrics.
- They allow comparison with industry benchmarks, competitors, or historical performance.


### 3. üìà Comparative Analysis Explained

Comparative analysis is about evaluating a company‚Äôs financial statements over multiple periods to identify trends and changes.

- It helps answer questions like: Is the company growing? Are profits increasing? Are expenses under control?
- There are three types of comparisons:
  - **Intra-company:** Comparing the company‚Äôs own performance over time.
  - **Inter-company:** Comparing with other companies.
  - **Industry averages:** Comparing with industry benchmarks.

By spotting upward or downward trends, stakeholders can make better decisions about investment, lending, or management strategies.


### 4. üìä Vertical Analysis (Common Size Statements)

Vertical analysis focuses on the **composition** of financial statements within a single period.

- Each line item is expressed as a percentage of a base figure.
- This standardization allows easy comparison between companies or periods, regardless of size.
- For example, if inventory is 20% of total assets, this tells you how significant inventory is in the company‚Äôs asset structure.

Vertical analysis helps identify **which components dominate the financial statements** and highlights potential areas of concern or strength.


### 5. üìê Financial Ratio Analysis: Types and Importance

Financial ratio analysis is a powerful tool to evaluate a company‚Äôs financial condition quantitatively. It involves calculating ratios that reflect different aspects of the business:

#### 5.1 Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios measure a company‚Äôs ability to meet **short-term obligations** using its current assets.

- **Current Ratio:** Current assets √∑ Current liabilities. A ratio above 1 means the company can cover its short-term debts.
- **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test):** (Current assets - Inventory) √∑ Current liabilities. This excludes inventory because it may not be quickly converted to cash.
- **Cash Ratio:** Cash and cash equivalents √∑ Current liabilities. The most conservative measure, focusing only on cash.

These ratios are crucial for creditors and investors to assess if the company can pay its bills on time.

#### 5.2 Solvency Ratios

Solvency ratios assess the company‚Äôs ability to meet **long-term debt obligations** and remain financially stable.

- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total debt √∑ Shareholders‚Äô equity. Indicates how much debt the company uses compared to equity.
- **Debt Ratio:** Total debt √∑ Total assets. Shows the proportion of assets financed by debt.
- **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) √∑ Interest expense. Measures the ability to pay interest on debt.

These ratios help evaluate financial risk and long-term sustainability.

#### 5.3 Efficiency Ratios

Efficiency ratios measure how well a company uses its assets and manages its liabilities.

- **Inventory Turnover:** Cost of goods sold √∑ Average inventory. Shows how quickly inventory is sold.
- **Days Sales of Inventory (DSI):** Number of days to sell inventory.
- **Accounts Receivable Turnover:** Net credit sales √∑ Average accounts receivable. Measures how quickly receivables are collected.
- **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):** Average collection period for receivables.
- **Asset Turnover:** Sales √∑ Average total assets. Indicates how efficiently assets generate sales.
- **Payable Turnover:** Purchases √∑ Average accounts payable. Shows how quickly the company pays suppliers.
- **Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):** Average days to pay suppliers.
- **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** Time taken to convert inventory and receivables into cash minus the time to pay suppliers.

Efficiency ratios highlight operational effectiveness and working capital management.

#### 5.4 Profitability Ratios

Profitability ratios measure the company‚Äôs ability to generate profits relative to sales, assets, or equity.

- **Gross Profit Margin:** (Sales - Cost of goods sold) √∑ Sales. Shows profit from core operations.
- **Operating Profit Margin:** Operating income √∑ Sales. Reflects profitability from operations before interest and taxes.
- **Net Profit Margin:** Net income √∑ Sales. Overall profitability after all expenses.
- **Return on Assets (ROA):** Net income √∑ Average total assets. Profit generated per dollar of assets.
- **Return on Equity (ROE):** Net income √∑ Average shareholders‚Äô equity. Profit generated per dollar of equity.

These ratios are key for investors to assess how well the company is generating returns.

#### 5.5 Investor / Market Value Ratios

These ratios relate the company‚Äôs market value to its financial performance.

- **Earnings per Share (EPS):** Net income √∑ Number of outstanding shares. Profit per share.
- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** Market price per share √∑ EPS. Indicates market expectations.
- **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:** Market price per share √∑ Book value per share. Shows market valuation relative to net assets.
- **Dividend Yield:** Annual dividends per share √∑ Market price per share. Return from dividends.

These ratios help investors decide if a stock is fairly valued or attractive.
