## 3. Statement of Changes of Equity  Statement of Cash Flow

## Key Points

#### 1. üìà Statement of Changes in Equity  
- Shows detailed changes in equity not visible in income statement or balance sheet alone.  
- Connects income statement with balance sheet by explaining equity movements.  
- Factors affecting equity: profits (increase), losses (decrease), dividends paid (decrease), new shares issued (increase), share buybacks (decrease), asset revaluation (increase/decrease).  
- Discloses capital contributions, profit retention, dividend policy, and capital withdrawals.

#### 2. üíµ Cash Flow Statement Objectives  
- Highlights cash inflows and outflows from different activities.  
- Helps understand liquidity and manage cash efficiently.  
- Predicts financial weaknesses and compares actual cash flow with budgets.  
- Determines ability to pay dividends and creditors.

#### 3. üßæ Cash Flow Statement Definitions  
- Cash: cash on hand and demand deposits.  
- Cash equivalents: short-term, highly liquid investments convertible to cash with insignificant risk.  
- Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents.

#### 4. üîÑ Classification of Cash Flows  
- Operating activities: cash flows from day-to-day revenue-producing activities (e.g., cash from customers, payments to suppliers/employees).  
- Investing activities: cash flows from acquisition/disposal of long-term assets and investments (e.g., purchase/sale of machinery, land).  
- Financing activities: cash flows affecting equity and borrowings (e.g., issuing shares, paying dividends, borrowing/repaying loans).

#### 5. üßÆ Methods of Preparing Cash Flow Statement  
- Direct method: converts income statement items directly into cash receipts and payments.  
- Indirect method: starts with net income, adjusts for non-cash expenses (depreciation), gains/losses on asset sales, and changes in working capital.  
- Both methods yield the same net cash flow from operating activities.  
- Cash flows from investing and financing activities are calculated identically in both methods.

#### 6. ‚öôÔ∏è Indirect Method Adjustment Steps  
- Add back non-cash expenses (e.g., depreciation).  
- Subtract gains on disposal of fixed assets and interest income (investing activities).  
- Add back losses on disposal of fixed assets and interest expenses (financing activities).  
- Adjust for changes in current assets and liabilities:  
  - Increase in current assets ‚Üí subtract from net income.  
  - Increase in current liabilities ‚Üí add to net income.  
  - Decrease in current assets ‚Üí add to net income.  
  - Decrease in current liabilities ‚Üí subtract from net income.

#### 7. üí° Important Cash Flow Treatment  
- Interest income classified as investing inflow.  
- Interest expense classified as financing outflow.  
- Dividends paid reduce equity and are financing outflows.  
- Share issues increase equity and are financing inflows.  
- Share buybacks reduce equity and are financing outflows.

## Study Notes

### 1. üìä Statement of Changes in Equity: Understanding How Ownership Value Evolves

#### Introduction to Statement of Changes in Equity  
The **Statement of Changes in Equity** is a financial report that explains how a company‚Äôs equity (ownership value) changes over a specific accounting period. Unlike the income statement or balance sheet, which show profits or financial position at a point in time, this statement reveals the detailed movements in equity accounts. It provides transparency and helps stakeholders understand how profits, dividends, share issues, and other factors affect the company‚Äôs net worth.

#### Why Prepare the Statement of Changes in Equity?  
- **Transparency:** It shows detailed changes in equity that are not visible in the income statement or balance sheet alone.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Helps shareholders, investors, and management assess company stability, profitability, and capital management.  
- **Link Between Financial Statements:** Connects the income statement (which shows profit or loss) with the balance sheet (which shows equity at a point in time) by explaining how equity has moved.  
- **Financial Health Insight:** Reveals how well management generates profits and manages distributions like dividends.  
- **Capital Movements:** Discloses new capital contributions, retained earnings, dividend payments, and share buybacks, giving clarity on how the company‚Äôs capital structure changes.  
- **Investor and Creditor Confidence:** Provides information on the company‚Äôs ability to generate and retain value, which is crucial for investment and lending decisions.

#### Key Factors Affecting Equity  
- **Profits Earned:** Increase equity because retained earnings grow.  
- **Losses Incurred:** Decrease equity as they reduce retained earnings.  
- **Dividends Declared and Paid:** Decrease equity because profits are distributed to shareholders.  
- **Issue of New Shares:** Increase equity by bringing in new capital.  
- **Share Buybacks or Redemptions:** Decrease equity as the company repurchases its own shares.  
- **Changes in Asset Fair Value:** Adjustments booked directly to reserves can increase or decrease equity depending on whether asset values rise or fall.

#### Format of the Statement  
Typically, the statement lists the opening equity balance, adds profits or subtracts losses, adjusts for dividends, share issues, buybacks, and other changes, then shows the closing equity balance.


### 2. üíµ Statement of Cash Flows: Tracking the Movement of Cash

#### Introduction to Cash Flow Statement  
The **Statement of Cash Flows** is a financial report that shows how cash moves in and out of a business during an accounting period. Unlike profit, which includes non-cash items, cash flow focuses solely on actual cash transactions. This statement is essential because cash is the lifeblood of any business ‚Äî it pays bills, funds operations, and supports growth.

#### Objectives of the Cash Flow Statement  
- **Highlight Cash Inflows and Outflows:** Shows where cash is coming from and where it is going.  
- **Understand Liquidity:** Helps assess if the company has enough cash to meet short-term obligations.  
- **Manage Cash Efficiently:** Enables better planning and control of cash resources.  
- **Predict Weaknesses:** Identifies potential cash shortages or financial stress.  
- **Compare with Budgets:** Helps management compare actual cash flows with planned budgets.  
- **Determine Dividend and Debt Payment Ability:** Shows if the company can pay dividends to shareholders and meet creditor obligations.

#### Key Definitions  
- **Cash:** Includes cash on hand and demand deposits (immediately available funds).  
- **Cash Equivalents:** Short-term, highly liquid investments that can be quickly converted to cash with minimal risk of value change (e.g., treasury bills).  
- **Cash Flows:** The inflows (receipts) and outflows (payments) of cash and cash equivalents.


### 3. üîÑ Classification of Cash Flows: Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities

#### Operating Activities  
These are the core business activities that generate revenue and expenses daily. Operating cash flows include:  
- Cash received from customers for sales of goods or services.  
- Cash paid to suppliers for inventory and operating expenses.  
- Cash paid to employees as wages.  
- Other cash payments related to day-to-day operations.  

Operating cash flow reflects the company‚Äôs ability to generate cash from its main business activities, excluding investing or financing transactions.

#### Investing Activities  
Investing activities relate to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investments, such as:  
- Purchase or sale of property, plant, and equipment (fixed assets).  
- Purchase or sale of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) that are not cash equivalents.  

Cash flows from investing activities show how much the company is spending on or earning from investments in its future operations.

#### Financing Activities  
Financing activities involve changes in the company‚Äôs capital structure, including:  
- Issuing new shares (increases equity).  
- Borrowing money or repaying loans (affects liabilities).  
- Paying dividends to shareholders (reduces equity).  
- Share buybacks or redemptions (reduces equity).  

These activities show how the company raises capital and returns value to shareholders or creditors.


### 4. üßæ Preparing the Cash Flow Statement: Direct vs Indirect Methods

#### Overview  
The cash flow statement can be prepared using two methods, differing only in how operating cash flows are calculated. Both methods produce the same net cash flow from operating activities.

#### Direct Method  
- Converts each income statement item into cash terms.  
- For example, sales revenue is converted to cash received from customers, expenses to cash paid to suppliers and employees.  
- Provides a clear view of actual cash receipts and payments.  
- Preferred by some users for its straightforwardness but less commonly used due to data collection complexity.

#### Indirect Method  
- Starts with net income from the income statement.  
- Adjusts for non-cash expenses (like depreciation) by adding them back.  
- Removes gains or losses related to investing or financing activities (e.g., gain on sale of assets).  
- Adjusts for changes in working capital (current assets and liabilities):  
  - Increase in current assets reduces cash (subtracted).  
  - Increase in current liabilities increases cash (added).  
  - Decrease in current assets increases cash (added).  
  - Decrease in current liabilities reduces cash (subtracted).  
- Arrives at net cash flow from operating activities after these adjustments.


### 5. üßÆ Practical Exercises: Applying Concepts to Real Data

#### Exercise Examples  
- **Exercise 1:** Prepare a cash flow statement using the direct method from a company‚Äôs cash book. This involves listing all cash receipts and payments directly.  
- **Exercise 2:** Calculate net cash flow from operating activities using the indirect method from a profit and loss account. This requires adjusting net income for non-cash items and working capital changes.  
- **Exercise 3:** Calculate net cash flow from investing activities by analyzing asset purchases and sales, including depreciation and gains or losses on asset sales.  
- **Exercise 4 & 5:** Calculate net cash flow from financing activities by considering share issues, dividend payments, interest on loans and debentures, and share buybacks.

#### Important Notes for Exercises  
- Depreciation is a non-cash expense and must be added back when calculating cash flows.  
- Gains on asset sales are subtracted from net income in operating cash flow because they are investing activities.  
- Losses on asset sales are added back for the same reason.  
- Interest paid on loans is a financing activity, while interest received is an investing activity.  
- Dividends paid reduce cash in financing activities.


### Summary  
Understanding the **Statement of Changes in Equity** and the **Statement of Cash Flows** is crucial for analyzing a company‚Äôs financial health beyond just profits and assets. The changes in equity statement explain how ownership value changes due to profits, dividends, and capital movements. The cash flow statement reveals the actual cash movements, classified into operating, investing, and financing activities, helping assess liquidity and cash management. Mastery of both statements, including preparation methods and practical application, is essential for financial analysis, decision-making, and interviews in finance-related roles.
