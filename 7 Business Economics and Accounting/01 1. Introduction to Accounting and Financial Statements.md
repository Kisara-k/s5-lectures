## Study Notes

### 1. üìö Introduction to Accounting and Financial Statements

Accounting is often described as the language of business. It involves systematically recording, analyzing, and reporting financial transactions to provide useful information for decision-making. Financial statements are the end products of accounting, summarizing the financial performance and position of a business over a specific period.

#### Why Should Engineers Learn Accounting?

Although engineering focuses on technical skills, understanding accounting is crucial for engineers because:

- It helps evaluate whether a business or project is profitable.
- It provides insight into the financial health and sustainability of operations.
- It ensures compliance with legal requirements for financial reporting.
- It aids in organizing and managing financial activities effectively, minimizing errors or omissions.

In essence, accounting knowledge empowers engineers to make informed decisions, manage budgets, and communicate effectively with financial professionals.


### 2. üßæ The Accounting Process and Its Main Stages

Accounting is more than just recording numbers. It involves a series of steps to transform raw financial data into meaningful information.

#### Bookkeeping vs. Accounting

- **Bookkeeping** is the foundational step focused on the orderly recording of all business transactions. It‚Äôs about maintaining accurate and permanent records of money movements.
- **Accounting** builds on bookkeeping by analyzing, classifying, summarizing, and interpreting these records to produce financial statements and insights.

#### Definitions

- **Bookkeeping**: The science and art of correctly recording all business transactions involving money or money‚Äôs worth.
- **Accounting**: The art of recording, classifying, summarizing, and interpreting financial transactions in monetary terms to provide useful information for decision-making.

#### Objectives of Accounting

- Maintain accurate records of all transactions.
- Calculate net profit or loss.
- Determine the financial position (assets vs. liabilities).
- Communicate financial information to users.
- Fulfill legal and regulatory requirements.
- Support management decisions and attract investors.


### 3. üë• Users of Accounting Information

Accounting information serves different groups, each with unique needs:

#### Internal Users

- **Owners** want to know profitability and financial stability.
- **Management** uses accounting data to make operational and strategic decisions.
- **Employees and Trade Unions** assess the company‚Äôs ability to pay salaries, bonuses, and benefits.

#### External Users

- **Creditors and Banks** evaluate if loans and interest will be repaid on time.
- **Present Investors** monitor the company‚Äôs progress and safety of their investments.
- **Potential Investors** decide whether to invest based on financial health.
- **Government and Tax Authorities** assess tax liabilities.
- **Regulatory Agencies** ensure compliance with laws and regulations.


### 4. üè∑Ô∏è Branches of Accounting

Accounting is divided into specialized areas, each serving different purposes:

- **Financial Accounting**: Focuses on recording transactions to prepare financial statements showing results over a period and financial position at a point in time.
- **Cost Accounting**: Deals with determining the cost of production or jobs by collecting and classifying costs.
- **Management Accounting**: Uses data from financial and cost accounting to help management with planning, control, and decision-making.


### 5. üìè Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Conventions, and Concepts

Accounting follows a set of fundamental principles and concepts to ensure consistency, reliability, and comparability of financial information. These principles guide how transactions are recorded and reported.

#### Business Entity Concept

This principle treats the business as a separate entity distinct from its owners or capital providers. All business transactions must be recorded separately from personal transactions of the owners. This separation is essential for accurate financial reporting.

#### Money Measurement Concept

Only transactions that can be measured in monetary terms are recorded. Non-quantifiable items like employee morale or customer satisfaction are not recorded because they cannot be expressed in currency.

#### Historical Cost Concept

Assets are recorded at their original purchase price, not their current market value. For example, land bought for Rs. 5 Lakhs remains recorded at Rs. 5 Lakhs even if its market value changes.

#### Periodic Concept

Financial performance is measured over specific periods, such as a calendar year (Jan 1 - Dec 31) or a financial year (Apr 1 - Mar 31). This allows for regular reporting and comparison.

#### Matching Concept

Expenses must be matched with the revenues they help generate within the same accounting period. For example, sales commissions are recorded in the same period as the related sales revenue to avoid misstating profit.

#### Materiality Concept

Information is material if its omission or misstatement could influence decisions of users. Both the size (amount) and nature (quality) of an item are considered. For instance, a small calculator costing Rs. 500 might be expensed immediately rather than capitalized because it‚Äôs not material.

#### Going Concern Concept

Assumes the business will continue operating indefinitely, not planning to close or liquidate soon. This justifies recording assets at cost and spreading expenses over time.

#### Consistency Concept

Once an accounting method or policy is chosen, it should be applied consistently across periods to allow comparability. Changes are allowed only with valid reasons and must follow accounting standards (e.g., LKAS 08).

#### Accrual Concept

Revenues and expenses are recognized when they are earned or incurred, not necessarily when cash is received or paid. For example, salaries payable and trade receivables are recorded even if cash hasn‚Äôt changed hands yet. Most companies are required by law to use accrual accounting.

#### Realization Concept

Revenue is recognized only when goods or services are delivered, fulfilling the performance obligation. For example, revenue from selling a machine is recorded when the machine is delivered to the customer.

#### Prudence Concept

Also known as conservatism, this principle requires not overstating assets or profits and not understating liabilities or losses. For example, provisions for doubtful debts or stock losses are recognized to avoid overstating financial health.


### 6. üîç Applying Concepts to Real Scenarios

Understanding how these principles apply in practice is key:

- **Closing stock deducted from cost** ‚Üí Matching Concept (expenses matched with revenue).
- **Owner‚Äôs delivery van recorded at cost** ‚Üí Business Entity Concept (separating business and personal assets).
- **Depreciation of assets** ‚Üí Matching Concept (allocating asset cost over useful life).
- **Credit sales recorded as income** ‚Üí Accrual Concept (revenue recognized when earned, not received).
- **Consistent dividend policy over years** ‚Üí Consistency Concept (same policy applied over time).
- **Capitalizing software costs** ‚Üí Materiality Concept (significant expenditure treated as asset).
- **Closing stock valued at lower of cost or net realizable value** ‚Üí Prudence Concept (avoiding overstatement of assets).


### Summary

Accounting is a structured process that transforms financial data into meaningful information through recording, classifying, summarizing, and interpreting transactions. It follows established principles to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usefulness. Understanding these fundamentals is essential not only for accountants but also for engineers and other professionals who need to make informed business decisions.
