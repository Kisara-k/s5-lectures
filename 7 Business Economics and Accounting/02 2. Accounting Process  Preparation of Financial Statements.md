## Key Points

#### 1. üìö Accounting Process  
- The accounting process includes identifying transactions, preparing source documents, recording in prime entry books, posting to the general ledger, preparing a trial balance, and preparing financial statements.  
- Prime entry books are the first place transactions are recorded before posting to the ledger.

- Sales Journal records only credit sales of goods.  
- Purchases Return Journal records goods returned to suppliers.  
- Sales Return Journal records goods returned by customers.  
- Cash Receipt/Payment Journal records all cash receipts and payments.  
- General Journal records transactions not recorded in other journals.

#### 3. üìÑ Source Documents  
- Purchase Invoice supports entries in Purchases Journal.  
- Sales Invoice supports entries in Sales Journal.  
- Debit Note supports Purchases Return Journal.  
- Credit Note supports Sales Return Journal.  
- Cash Receipt/Payment Voucher supports Cash Journals.  
- Journal Voucher supports General Journal entries.

#### 4. üí° Elements of Financial Statements  
- Asset: Present economic resource controlled by the entity from past events, expected to produce economic benefits.  
- Liability: Present obligation to transfer economic resources due to past events, which the entity cannot avoid.  
- Equity: Residual interest in assets after deducting liabilities.  
- Income: Increases in assets or decreases in liabilities that increase equity, excluding owner contributions.

## Study Notes

### 1. üìö Introduction to the Accounting Process

Accounting is the systematic process of recording, summarizing, and reporting financial transactions of a business. The **accounting process** involves several key steps that ensure accurate financial information is prepared and presented. This process helps businesses track their financial performance and position, which is essential for decision-making by management, investors, creditors, and other stakeholders.

The main stages in the accounting process include:

- **Identifying transactions**: Recognizing financial events that affect the business.
- **Preparing source documents**: Collecting evidence like invoices, receipts, and vouchers.
- **Recording in prime entry books (journals)**: Initial recording of transactions in specialized books.
- **Posting to the general ledger**: Transferring journal entries to ledger accounts.
- **Preparing a trial balance**: Summarizing ledger balances to check accuracy.
- **Preparing financial statements**: Creating reports like the Trading Account, Profit & Loss Statement, and Statement of Financial Position.

Each step builds on the previous one to ensure the financial data is complete and accurate.


### 2. üìí Prime Entry Books (Journals) and Their Purpose

Prime entry books, also called **subsidiary books or journals**, are specialized books used to record transactions before they are posted to the ledger. They help organize transactions by type, making the accounting process more efficient and reducing errors.

Here are the main types of prime entry books and their uses:

- **Purchases Journal**: Records only credit purchases of goods. For example, when a business buys goods on credit from suppliers.
- **Sales Journal**: Records only credit sales of goods to customers.
- **Purchases Return Journal**: Records goods returned to suppliers.
- **Sales Return Journal**: Records goods returned by customers.
- **Cash Receipt Journal**: Records all cash received by the business.
- **Cash Payment Journal**: Records all cash payments made by the business.
- **General Journal**: Records transactions that do not fit into the above journals, such as depreciation or correcting entries.

Each journal entry is supported by a **source document** (e.g., purchase invoice, sales invoice, debit note, credit note, cash voucher) which provides evidence of the transaction.


### 3. üí° Key Elements of Financial Statements

Financial statements are reports that summarize the financial performance and position of a business. They are based on five fundamental elements:

- **Assets**: These are economic resources controlled by the business as a result of past events, which are expected to bring future economic benefits. Examples include cash, inventory, buildings, and equipment.
  
- **Liabilities**: Present obligations the business must settle, usually by transferring economic resources (like cash) to others. These arise from past transactions and the business cannot avoid them. Examples include loans, accounts payable, and mortgages.
  
- **Equity**: The residual interest in the assets after deducting liabilities. It represents the owner‚Äôs claim on the business assets. Equity increases with profits and owner contributions and decreases with losses and withdrawals.
  
- **Income**: Increases in assets or decreases in liabilities that result in an increase in equity, excluding owner contributions. Examples include sales revenue, interest income, and rent received.
  
- **Expenses**: Decreases in assets or increases in liabilities that reduce equity, excluding distributions to owners. Examples include rent paid, salaries, utilities, and depreciation.


### 4. üîÑ The Double Entry System and Accounting Equation

The **double entry system** is the foundation of modern accounting. It states that every business transaction has two effects: one account is debited, and another is credited, keeping the accounting equation balanced.

The **accounting equation** is:

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

This can be expanded to:

**Assets = Capital + (Income - Expenses) + Liabilities**

Where:

- **Debit** entries increase assets and expenses but decrease liabilities, income, and equity.
- **Credit** entries increase liabilities, income, and equity but decrease assets and expenses.

For example, if a business purchases furniture for cash:

- Furniture (asset) increases ‚Üí Debit Furniture account
- Cash (asset) decreases ‚Üí Credit Cash account

This ensures the equation remains balanced.


### 5. üßæ Recording Transactions: Step-by-Step Examples

Let‚Äôs walk through some example transactions to see how they affect the accounting equation:

1. **Owner invests Rs. 50,000 cash into the business**  
   - Increase Cash (Asset) by Rs. 50,000 (Debit)  
   - Increase Capital (Equity) by Rs. 50,000 (Credit)

2. **Purchase furniture for Rs. 5,000 cash**  
   - Increase Furniture (Asset) by Rs. 5,000 (Debit)  
   - Decrease Cash (Asset) by Rs. 5,000 (Credit)

3. **Purchase goods for Rs. 30,000 cash**  
   - Increase Inventory (Asset) by Rs. 30,000 (Debit)  
   - Decrease Cash (Asset) by Rs. 30,000 (Credit)

4. **Purchase goods on credit for Rs. 20,000**  
   - Increase Inventory (Asset) by Rs. 20,000 (Debit)  
   - Increase Trade Payables (Liability) by Rs. 20,000 (Credit)

5. **Sell goods costing Rs. 25,000 on credit for Rs. 35,000**  
   - Increase Trade Receivables (Asset) by Rs. 35,000 (Debit)  
   - Increase Sales Income (Equity) by Rs. 35,000 (Credit)  
   - Decrease Inventory (Asset) by Rs. 25,000 (Credit)  
   - Increase Cost of Sales (Expense) by Rs. 25,000 (Debit)

6. **Pay rent Rs. 3,000 cash**  
   - Decrease Cash (Asset) by Rs. 3,000 (Credit)  
   - Increase Rent Expense (Expense) by Rs. 3,000 (Debit)

This example shows how each transaction affects different accounts but keeps the accounting equation balanced.


### 6. üìä Preparation of Financial Statements

#### Trading Account

The **Trading Account** calculates the **gross profit** earned from buying and selling goods during a specific period (usually one year). It focuses on the core trading activities.

- **Cost of Sales** is a key figure calculated as:  
  **Cost of Sales = Opening Stock + Purchases + Additional Costs - Purchase Returns - Closing Stock**

- **Opening Stock**: Value of inventory left from the previous year.  
- **Purchases**: Cost of goods bought during the year, including carriage and import duties.  
- **Purchase Returns**: Goods returned to suppliers, deducted from purchases.  
- **Closing Stock**: Inventory remaining at the end of the year, subtracted because it was not sold.

**Gross Profit** is then calculated as:  
**Gross Profit = Sales - Cost of Sales**


#### Profit and Loss (P&L) and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) Statement

The **P&L and OCI Statement** shows the net profit or loss after accounting for all expenses and incomes during the period.

- **Administration Expenses**: Costs related to running the business (e.g., wages, insurance, electricity).  
- **Distribution Expenses**: Costs related to selling and delivering goods (e.g., advertising, delivery van expenses).  
- **Financial Expenses**: Costs related to borrowing money (e.g., interest on loans, bank charges).

The format typically starts with **Gross Profit**, adds other income (like rent received), then deducts all expenses to arrive at **Net Profit**.


#### Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet)

The **Statement of Financial Position** shows the financial position of the business at a specific date, detailing what the business owns and owes.

- **Non-current Assets**: Long-term assets like buildings, machinery, and vehicles.  
- **Current Assets**: Short-term assets like cash, inventory, and receivables.  
- **Liabilities**: Divided into current (due within one year) and non-current (long-term).  
- **Equity**: Owner‚Äôs capital plus retained earnings.

The statement follows the accounting equation:  
**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**
