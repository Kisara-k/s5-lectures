## Demand and Supply

## Key Points

#### 1. üìä Market and Product Types  
- A market is a set of arrangements where buyers and sellers exchange goods and services.  
- Types of markets include physical, intermediate (share market), supermarket (fixed prices), electronic, telecommunication, auction, differentiated, homogeneous, and geographical markets.  
- Product types include normal, inferior, Giffen, Veblen, independent/dependent, substitute, and complementary products.

#### 2. üìâ Law of Demand  
- Demand is the quantity consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices.  
- The demand curve slopes downward: as price rises, quantity demanded falls; as price falls, quantity demanded rises.  
- The inverse relationship is explained by the substitution effect (consumers switch to cheaper alternatives when price rises) and income effect (real income falls when price rises, reducing consumption).

#### 3. üîÑ Demand Curve Shifts vs. Movements  
- A movement along the demand curve is caused by a change in the product‚Äôs price (change in quantity demanded).  
- A shift in the demand curve is caused by changes in non-price determinants such as consumer income, tastes, population, prices of related goods, and expectations (change in demand).

#### 4. üí∞ Determinants of Demand  
- Number of consumers (market size)  
- Consumer income (higher income increases demand for normal goods, decreases for inferior goods)  
- Consumer preferences and tastes  
- Prices of related goods: substitutes (price increase in substitute increases demand) and complements (price increase in complement decreases demand)  
- Expectations about future prices or income

#### 5. üìà Law of Supply  
- Supply is the quantity producers are willing and able to sell at various prices.  
- The supply curve slopes upward: as price rises, quantity supplied rises; as price falls, quantity supplied falls.  
- Price and quantity supplied are positively related.

#### 6. üîÑ Supply Curve Shifts vs. Movements  
- A movement along the supply curve is caused by a change in the product‚Äôs price (change in quantity supplied).  
- A shift in the supply curve is caused by changes in non-price determinants such as input costs, technology, number of sellers, and government policies.

#### 7. ‚öôÔ∏è Determinants of Supply  
- Input costs (higher costs shift supply curve left)  
- Technological improvements (shift supply curve right)  
- Number of producers (more producers shift supply curve right)  
- Government regulations, taxes, subsidies  
- Expectations about future prices or costs

#### 8. ‚öñÔ∏è Market Equilibrium  
- Market equilibrium occurs where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.  
- Equilibrium price is the price at which the market clears (no surplus or shortage).  
- If price is above equilibrium, surplus occurs, causing price to fall.  
- If price is below equilibrium, shortage occurs, causing price to rise.

#### 9. üîÑ Changes in Equilibrium  
- Increase in demand shifts demand curve right ‚Üí higher price and quantity.  
- Decrease in demand shifts demand curve left ‚Üí lower price and quantity.  
- Increase in supply shifts supply curve right ‚Üí lower price and higher quantity.  
- Decrease in supply shifts supply curve left ‚Üí higher price and lower quantity.

#### 10. üîÄ Simultaneous Shifts in Demand and Supply  
- Increase in both demand and supply ‚Üí quantity increases; price change is uncertain.  
- Increase in demand and decrease in supply ‚Üí price increases; quantity change is uncertain.

#### 11. üîç Substitutes and Complements in Market Interaction  
- If the price of a substitute rises, demand for the original good increases (demand curve shifts right).  
- If the price of a complement rises, demand for the original good decreases (demand curve shifts left).

## Study Notes

### 1. üõí What is a Market? ‚Äî Introduction to Market Types and Products

A **market** is essentially a system or arrangement where buyers and sellers come into contact to exchange goods and services. This exchange can happen in many different ways and places, and understanding the types of markets and products is fundamental to grasping demand and supply.

#### Types of Markets

- **Physical Markets:** Buyers, sellers, and goods are physically present in the same location (e.g., a farmers‚Äô market).
- **Intermediate Markets:** Such as the stock or share market, where transactions happen through intermediaries.
- **Supermarkets:** Prices are usually fixed and goods are displayed for consumers.
- **Electronic Markets:** Online platforms like Amazon or eBay where buying and selling happen over the internet.
- **Telecommunication Markets:** Transactions via phone, fax, or video calls.
- **Auction Markets:** Where prices are determined by bidding ‚Äî can be ascending (price goes up), descending (price goes down), or sealed bids (hidden offers).
- **Differentiated Markets:** Products differ by customer preferences, quality, or features.
- **Homogeneous Markets:** Products are identical and sold at the same price (e.g., wheat or crude oil).
- **Geographical Markets:** Markets defined by location, such as city, rural, or regional markets.

#### Types of Products

- **Normal Products:** Demand increases as consumer income rises and decreases when income falls (e.g., electronics).
- **Inferior Products:** Demand decreases as income rises and increases when income falls (e.g., cheaper alternatives like instant noodles).
- **Giffen Products:** A rare type of inferior good where demand increases as price rises, causing an upward-sloping demand curve (e.g., staple foods in some poor regions).
- **Veblen Products:** Luxury goods where higher prices make the product more desirable (e.g., designer jewelry).
- **Independent Products:** Goods consumed independently without reliance on others.
- **Dependent Products:** Goods that require other products to be useful (e.g., printers and ink cartridges).
- **Substitute Products:** Goods that can replace each other (e.g., tea and coffee).
- **Complementary Products:** Goods used together (e.g., cars and petrol).


### 2. üìâ Demand: Understanding Consumer Behavior and Demand Curves

**Demand** refers to how much of a product or service consumers are willing and able to buy at different prices over a period of time.

#### The Law of Demand

The **Law of Demand** states that, *all else being equal*, when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded falls, and when the price falls, the quantity demanded rises. This inverse relationship is why the demand curve slopes downward.

#### Why Does Demand Curve Slope Downward?

Two main effects explain this:

- **Substitution Effect:** When the price of a good rises, consumers switch to cheaper alternatives, reducing the quantity demanded of the more expensive good.
- **Income Effect:** When the price rises, consumers‚Äô real purchasing power decreases, so they buy less of the good.

#### Demand Curve and Demand Schedule

- A **demand schedule** is a table showing the quantity demanded at different prices.
- A **demand curve** is a graphical representation of this schedule, with price on the vertical axis and quantity demanded on the horizontal axis.

#### Changes in Demand vs. Changes in Quantity Demanded

- **Change in Quantity Demanded:** Movement *along* the demand curve caused by a change in the product‚Äôs price.
- **Change in Demand:** A *shift* of the entire demand curve caused by changes in non-price factors (determinants of demand).

#### Determinants of Demand (Factors that Shift the Demand Curve)

- **Number of Consumers:** More consumers increase demand (shift right).
- **Consumer Income:** Higher income increases demand for normal goods; decreases demand for inferior goods.
- **Consumer Preferences:** Trends or fashions can increase or decrease demand.
- **Prices of Related Goods:**
  - **Substitutes:** If the price of a substitute rises, demand for the original good increases.
  - **Complements:** If the price of a complement rises, demand for the original good decreases.
- **Expectations:** If consumers expect prices to rise in the future, current demand may increase.

#### Examples of Demand Shifts

- If incomes rise, the demand curve shifts right (increase in demand).
- If a new health study shows coffee is bad for health, demand for coffee shifts left (decrease in demand).


### 3. üìà Supply: Producer Behavior and Supply Curves

**Supply** is the quantity of a product that producers are willing and able to sell at different prices over a period of time.

#### The Law of Supply

The **Law of Supply** states that, *all else being equal*, when the price of a product increases, the quantity supplied increases, and when the price decreases, the quantity supplied decreases. This positive relationship causes the supply curve to slope upward.

#### Supply Curve and Supply Schedule

- A **supply schedule** is a table showing the quantity supplied at different prices.
- A **supply curve** is a graphical representation with price on the vertical axis and quantity supplied on the horizontal axis.

#### Changes in Supply vs. Changes in Quantity Supplied

- **Change in Quantity Supplied:** Movement *along* the supply curve due to a change in price.
- **Change in Supply:** A *shift* of the entire supply curve caused by changes in non-price factors.

#### Determinants of Supply (Factors that Shift the Supply Curve)

- **Input Costs:** Higher costs (e.g., wages, raw materials) shift supply curve left (decrease supply).
- **Technology:** Improvements reduce production costs, shifting supply curve right (increase supply).
- **Number of Sellers:** More firms increase supply (shift right).
- **Government Policies:** Taxes, subsidies, or regulations can shift supply.
- **Expectations:** If producers expect higher future prices, they may reduce current supply.

#### Example of Supply Shift

- A new technology that automates production shifts supply curve right.
- An increase in rent for coffee shops shifts supply curve left (less supply).


### 4. ‚öñÔ∏è Market Equilibrium: Where Demand Meets Supply

**Market equilibrium** occurs where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. This point determines the **equilibrium price** and **equilibrium quantity**.

#### How Equilibrium Works

- At equilibrium price, the market "clears" ‚Äî no surplus or shortage.
- If the price is **above equilibrium**, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, causing a **surplus**. Sellers lower prices to clear excess stock.
- If the price is **below equilibrium**, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, causing a **shortage**. Buyers compete, pushing prices up.

#### Graphical Representation

- The demand curve slopes downward.
- The supply curve slopes upward.
- The intersection point is the equilibrium.

#### Changes in Equilibrium

There are four main scenarios:

1. **Increase in Demand:** Shifts demand curve right ‚Üí higher price and quantity.
2. **Decrease in Demand:** Shifts demand curve left ‚Üí lower price and quantity.
3. **Increase in Supply:** Shifts supply curve right ‚Üí lower price and higher quantity.
4. **Decrease in Supply:** Shifts supply curve left ‚Üí higher price and lower quantity.


### 5. üîÑ Interactions Between Demand and Supply: Complex Market Changes

Sometimes, both demand and supply change simultaneously, making the effect on price and quantity more complex.

#### When Both Demand and Supply Increase

- Quantity will definitely increase.
- Price may rise, fall, or stay the same depending on the relative magnitude of shifts.

#### When Demand Increases and Supply Decreases

- Price will definitely increase.
- Quantity change is uncertain ‚Äî it could increase, decrease, or stay the same.

#### Real-World Example: Tea and Coffee Market

- A cyclone damages tea plantations ‚Üí supply of tea decreases ‚Üí supply curve shifts left ‚Üí tea prices rise.
- Coffee is a substitute for tea ‚Üí demand for coffee increases ‚Üí demand curve shifts right ‚Üí coffee prices rise.


### 6. üîç Key Concepts for Interviews: Summary and Application

- **Understand the difference between a movement along a curve (price change) and a shift of the curve (non-price factors).**
- **Be able to explain why demand curves slope downward (substitution and income effects).**
- **Know the determinants that shift demand and supply curves.**
- **Explain market equilibrium and how surpluses and shortages push prices back to equilibrium.**
- **Be ready to analyze simultaneous shifts in demand and supply and predict effects on price and quantity.**
- **Use real-world examples to illustrate concepts (e.g., impact of natural disasters on supply, substitutes and complements).**


### 7. üìù Practice Questions (Summary)

- Calculate equilibrium price and quantity given demand and supply equations.
- Explain market effects of supply shocks (e.g., disease reducing meat supply).
- Discuss if rising price and quantity sold violates the law of demand (it does not if demand curve shifts).
- Analyze market surplus or shortage at different prices.
- Predict effects of simultaneous shifts in demand and supply.


### Final Tips

- Always clarify if a change is a **movement along** a curve or a **shift** of the curve.
- Remember that **price is the signal** that balances demand and supply.
- Use graphs to visualize and explain your answers clearly.
- Relate theory to practical examples for better understanding and interview impact.
